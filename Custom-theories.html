            <h2>Weierstraß sine product (WSP)</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Sim time to completion:</b> 4 years and 333 days</li>
                <li><b>Dev:</b> Xaleroc</li>
                <li><b>Milestone route:</b> 0/0/3 -> 0/1/3 -> 4/1/3</li>
                <li><b>One sentence description:</b> TBA</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>T1 overview:</h3>
                <p>WSP is based of of Weierstrass' sine approximation: \(s_n(x) = x \Pi_{k=1}^n(1 - (\frac{x}{k\pi})^2)\).<br/>
                As n goes to infinity, sn(x) approaches sin(x)</p>
                <p>However, \(s_n(x)\) is quite inaccurate, and for large values of x, \(s_n(x)\) is much larger/smaller then sin(x), even for large values of n.<br/>
                Essentially, as x gets bigger, \(s_n(x) / sin(x)\) gets bigger, very fast, even for large values of n</p>
                <p>This theory exploits this inaccuracy, and uses it to increase \(\rho\)</p>

            <h3>Equation breakdown</h3>
                <blockquote>\(\dot{\rho} = q_1q_2q\)</blockquote>
                <blockquote>\(\dot{q} = c_2\frac{s_n(\chi)}{sin(\chi)}\)</blockquote>
                <blockquote>\(\chi = \pi \frac{c_1n}{c_1 + n / 3^3} + 1\)</blockquote>
                <p>These equation shows that to increase \(\rho\) you want to increase q</p>
                <p>To increase q you want to increase \(s_n(\chi) / sin(\chi)\), which is the stirling approximation from earlier.
                Thus to increase \(s_n(\chi) / sin(\chi)\), you want to increase \(\chi\).</p>
                <p>The third line shows how to increase \(\chi\)</p>
                <p>And thus we have the variable breakdown:</p>
                <table>
                    <tr><td>\(q_1\)</td><td>Increases \(\dot{\rho}\) directly by approx 7%</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>\(q_2\)</td><td>Increases \(\dot{\rho}\) directly by 2x</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>\(c_1\)</td><td>Increases \(\chi\) (affect changes over time)</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>\(n\)</td><td>Increases \(\chi\) (affect changes over time)</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>\(c_2\)</td><td>Increases \(\dot{q}\) by 2x</td></tr>
                </table>
                <p>\(c_1\) and \(n\) affect \(\dot{\rho}\) differently over time</p>
                <table>
                    <tr><td>\(c_1\)</td><td>Initially 50% increase in q. Decreases to 0 over time. Negligable after 1e400</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>\(n\)</td><td>Initially 50% increase in q. Increaces to 4x over time. Almost 4x after 1e400</td></tr>
                </table>

            <h3>Optimal publication multiplier:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>0 - e50: 2 - 4</li>
                    <li>e50 - e75: 5 - 7</li>
                    <li>e75+: ~8</li>
                </ul>

            <h3>Strategies:</h3>
                <p>The best strategy for WSP is always WSPdStopC1. This strategy changes to accommodate that changing power of \(c_1\) and \(n\). However, to
                simplify, I have a different strat written here: WSPdStopC1noMod. This is not a mainstream strat, so people may not know what you're talking
                about and the sim will not recommend it. The sim will recommend WSPdStopC1 instead.<br/>

            </ul>
            <h3>SL overview:</h3>
                <p>SL is based of a variation of stirlings approximation for e. Stirlings approximation is an expression that approaches e and x approches
                infinity:</p>
                <p>\(lim_{x \rightarrow \infty} \frac{x}{\sqrt[x]{x!}} = e\)</p>
                <p>In the theory \(\frac{x}{\sqrt[x]{x!}}\) is represetned the the symbol \(\gamma\)</p>
                <p>Essentially, the higher x is, the closer \(\gamma\) is to e</p>
                <p>Stirlings approximation is linear, that is, doubling x, makes \(\gamma\) twice as close to e</p>
                <p>Approximations like this are often used to calculate the value of e by plugging in larger and larger values for x</p>

            <h3>Equation breakdown</h3>
                <blockquote>\(\dot{\rho_1} = \frac{\sqrt{\rho_2}}{e - \gamma}\)</blockquote>
                <blockquote>\(\gamma = \frac{\rho_3}{\sqrt[\rho_3]{\rho_3!}}\)</blockquote>
                <blockquote>\(\dot{\rho_2} = a_1a_2a_3^{-ln(\rho_3)}\)</blockquote>
                <blockquote>\(\dot{\rho_3} = b_1b_2\)</blockquote>
                <blockquote>\(a_3 = 2\)</blockquote>
                <p>The first equation shows that \(\dot{\rho_1}\) is affected by \(\rho_2\) (half effectiveness) and how close \(\gamma\) is to e<br/>
                Half effectiveness means that quarupling \(\rho_2\) only doubles \(\rho_1\).</p>
                <p>The 2nd equation is stirlings approximation, and shows us that the closeness of gamma to e is proportional to \(\rho_3\)</p>
                <p>The next equations are simple and show that \(a_{12}\) increases \(\rho_2\) and \(b_{12}\) increases \(\rho_3\)</p>
                <p>Interestingly, \(\dot{\rho_2}\) is DECREASED by \(a_3\) and \(\rho_3\), meaning to increase \(\rho_2\) you should decrease those</p>
                <p>The final equation shows the value of \(a_3\) which can be lowered through milestones</p>

                <p>Overall the effectiveness of each variable is</p>

            </ul>

            <h3>Strategies:</h3>
            <p>every variable does not affect \(\rho_1\) directly, affecting either \(\rho_2\) or \(\rho_3\), which usually takes a while to build up. Therefore, near
            the end of a publication, you should stop buying them, because by the time the upgrades have built up, you've past the optimal pub multi. Thus we
            have the strat SLStopAd. I would like to remove the Mod part for simplicity, but I am afraid I may make the start unviable. Therefore I have
            decided NOT to list the active strat (SL is super idle anyway), as the speed gain from SLStopAd is rarely enough to justify using over the idle
            strat SLStopA.</p>

            <p>SL has a MS strat as well. This MS strat is quite difficult, however, without manual buying it might be not too bad. It's also good at get some
            MS practice in, <s>and if I have to suffer SLMS you all do too</s>. Therefore I have decided to include SLMS here as well (again, SLMSd is not
            included)</p>
            <h4>SLMS</h4>
            <p class="important">SLMS is a DIFFICULT strat to perform. If you are unable to do it, please feel free to ignore this section</p>
            <table>

            </table>
            <p>This notation tells you the priority order to buy milestones. For example \(4 \rightarrow 3 \rightarrow 1 \rightarrow 2\) means to max out the 4th
            milestone (from the top) then the 3rd then the 1st then the 2nd</p>

            </table>
            <p>This table tells you when to swap to each state. Start in state 1 and read the number in the box (I'm calling it "n"). When your \(\rho_1\)
            reaches "n" times less then the next \(b_{12}\) upgrade, swap to State 2. Now you have a new "n". When your \(\rho_1\) again reaches "n" times less
            then the next \(b_{12}\) upgrade with the new "n", swap to State 3 (note that for one of the stages there is no swapping to state 3.). Finally, when
            you can afford and buy the upgrade, or your \(\rho\) drops back down due to another upgrade, swap back to State 1</p>
            <p>For variable purcahse, follow the SLStopA strat. Therefore you don't have to worry about variables and just focus on the MS. If you want to take a
            break, just leave it in state 1 and come back. Any amount of active play is beneficial</p>
            <p>This strategy is over 2x faster then SLStopA, so I suggest doing it if you can and have the times too. Plus, it's more fun then just waiting</p>

            <h2>Eulers Formula (EF)</h2>

            </ul>

            <h3>EF overview:</h3>
            <p>EF is based of eulers formula: \(e^{i\theta} = cos(\theta) + i sin(\theta)\), where \(i = \sqrt{-1}\), the imaginary unit<br/>
            This means that as you increase θ, \(e^{i\theta}\) spirals around the origin (0, 0), always keeping a distance of 1. (and an angle of θ radians)</p>
            <p>For those who don't know, a complex number is a number in the form a + bi. I won't fully explain complex number here, but it is in essence a 2d
            number, in the form a + bi incread of (x, y). if we set z = a + bi, then Re(z) = a, and Im(z) = b.</p>
            <p>If you imagine the unit circle centered at the origin, then the value \(e^{i\theta}\) can be thought of a point 1 unit away fro mthe origin and
            \(\theta\) radians around the circle</p>
            <p>This formula will be used to generate 2 currencies, R and I, which are used to increase \(rho\).</p>
            <p>The equations in the theory have already expanded out eulers formula, and will be understandable if you have a good grasp of trigenometry, even if 
            you don't understan complex numbers</p>
            <p>Note that this theory's rho to tau rate is uniquely 1.6, this means that one must only reach 375 rho to max it out, and that tau increase 4 times
            faster with respect to rho, making this theory faster then it may seem when compared to the other CT's. This theory can feel extremely slow compared
            to other theories but it is actually one of the fastest</p>

            <h3>Equation breakdown</h3>
            <blockquote>\(\dot{\rho} = a_1a_2a_3 \sqrt{tq^2 + R^2 + I^2}\)</blockquote>
            <blockquote>\(G(t) = g_r + g_i\)</blockquote>
            <blockquote>\(g_r = b_1b_2cos(t), g_i = c_1c_2sin(t)\)</blockquote>
            <blockquote>\(\dot{q} = q_1q_2\)</blockquote>
            <blockquote>\(\dot{R} = (g_r)^2, \dot{I} = -(g_i)^2\)</blockquote>
            <p>The first line is the main equation, which shows that to increase \(\rho\) you want to increase \(a_1\), \(a_2\), \(a_3\), t, and q (R and I are
            effectively meaningless due to \(tq^2\) out competing them)<br/>
            The second line is the graph, G(t) is the graph drawn on screen<br/>
            The third line is Eulers formula, describing how \(g_r\) and \(g_i\) behave. Note that because they are squared below, negative values are fine<br/>
            The forth line simple describes q<br/>
            And the fifth line describes how R and I grow, based on the square of \(g_r\) and \(g_i\)</p>
            <p>Note that even though R and I are meaningless in the main equation, they are used to buy \(b_{12}\), \(c_{12}\), and \(a_{23}\), making them quite
            important</p>
            <p>And thus we have the variable breakdown:</p>

            <p>EF strategy involves d strats with variable's that cost \(\rho\), and balancing between b/c upgrades and \(a_2/a_3\) upgrades with variable that cost R/I.
            Always buy \(\dot{t}\) as soon as you can</p>
            <p>The idea with R and I are as follows: b/c upgrades increase R and I growth, but not \(\rho\). Early on, this is good becasue we need R and I to 
            buy \(a_{23}\), but later into the pub they are less valuble, as their bonus takes a while to actually take effect. Therefore, later into the pub,
            we should buy b/c upgrades less</p>

                <li><b>One sentence description:</b> TBA</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>CSR2 overview:</h3>
            <p>CSR2 is based on a reccurence relation that computes sqrt(2), which is the following 2 sequences:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The N sequence which goes: 1, 3, 7, 17, 41, 99...</li>
                <li>The D sequence which goes: 1, 2, 5, 12, 29, 70...</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Where the next term (\(N_m\)) is the previous term (\(N_{m-1}\)) times 2 plus the term before that (\(N_{m-2}\)), for both N and D, that is</p>
            <blockquote>\((N/D)_m = 2(N/D)_{m-1} + (N/D)_{m-2}\)</blockquote>
            <p>Interestingly, if we take the quotient of corresponding terms in both series (\(\frac{N_m}{D_m}\)) (like 1/1, 3/2, 7/5, 17/12 ect.) as we get
            further along, it approaches \(\sqrt{2}\). Essentially, as m approaches infinity, (\(\frac{N_m}{D_m}\)) approachs \(\sqrt{2}\)</p>

            <h3>Equation Breakdown</h3>
            <blockquote>\(\dot{\rho} = q_1q_2q\)</blockquote>
            <blockquote>\(\dot{q} = c_1c_2|\sqrt{2} - \frac{N_m}{D_m}|^{-1}\)</blockquote>
            <blockquote>\(N_m = 2N_{m-1} + N_{m-2}, N_0 = 1, N_1 = 3\)</blockquote>
            <blockquote>\(D_m = 2D_{m-1} + D_{m-2}, D_0 = 1, D_1 = 2\)</blockquote>
            <blockquote>\(m = n + log_2(c_2)\)</blockquote>
            <p>The first line is the main equation, which shows that to increase ρ you want to increase q1, q2, and q</p>
            <p>The second line is the equation for q, ehich shows that increase q you want to increase c1, c2, and get (\\frac{N_m}{D_m}\) closer to
            \(\sqrt{2}\)</p>
            <p>The third line and forth line is the recurrence relation described above, which shows to get (\\frac{N_m}{D_m}\) closer to \(\sqrt{2}\), you want
            to increase m.</p>
            <p>The fifth line is self explanatory</p>
            <p>Therefore, \(q_{12}\) affect \(\rho\) directly and \(c_{12}\) and \(n\) affects q directly (and by extention \(\rho\) indirectly)</p>
            <p>And thus we have the variable breakdown:</p>
            <table>
                <tr><td>\(q_1\)</td><td>Increases \(\dot{\rho}\) by approx. 7%</td></tr>
                <tr><td>\(q_2\)</td><td>Increases \(\dot{\rho}\) by 2x</td></tr>
                <tr><td>\(c_1\)</td><td>Increases \(\dot{q}\) by approx. 7%</td></tr>
                <tr><td>\(n\)  </td><td>Increases \(\dot{q}\) by 6x</td></tr>
                <tr><td>\(c_2\)</td><td>Increases \(\dot{q}\) by 22x!! (wtih full milestones)</td></tr>
            </table>
            <p>An increase in \(\dot{q}\) corresponds to an equivelent increase in \(\dot{\rho}\) over time</p>
            

            <h3>Optimal publication multiplier:</h3>
            <p>I've found it between 2 and 4.5 usually, but it varies</p>

            <h3>Strategies</h3>
            <p>CSR2's strat is pretty simple, really heavy d strats. Because of the large variable disparity, doing active strats is especially beneficial</p>
            <p>This is not the normal CSR2d recommended by the guide but I believe mine is slightly better. This is the only strat in this guide that is actually better</p>
            <h4>CSR2d+</h4>
            <table>
                <tr><td>\(q_1\)</td><td>10x cheaper then \(min(q_2, n, c_2)\)</td></tr>
                <tr><td>\(q_2\)</td><td>1.9x cheaper then \(min(n, c_2)\)</td></tr>
                <tr><td>\(q_1\)</td><td>10x cheaper then \(min(q_2, n, c_2)\)</td></tr>
                <tr><td>\(n\)</td><td>1.11x cheaper then \(c_2\)</td></tr>
                <tr><td>\(c_2\)</td><td style="color: green;">Always buy</td></tr>
            </table>
            <p>note that autobuying \(q_2\) and \(n\) is almost the same. In fact, that is the strat recommended by the guide</p>
            <p>There is a MS strat for CSR2. You can do CSR2XL x.xx explained 
            <a href="https://exponential-idle-guides.netlify.app/guides/theory-strategies/#csr2xl-xxx">here</a> or you can just do one swap at the end of your
            pub, which is swapping form the usual milestone route of "0/1/0 -> 0/1/2 -> 3/1/2" to "3/0 -> 3/1/0 -> 3/1/2" at the end of your pub, wait a bit, and
            then publish and swap back.</p>
