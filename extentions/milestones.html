            <p>Milestone swapping is a very powerful strategy. It was initially discovered as an exploit in theory 2, where it could be used to massively speed
            up pre-all milestones.</p>
            <p>Milestone swapping theories exist in all theories where:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>There exists a cumulative variable (like q in T4)</li>
                <li>There exists a milestone that buffs growth for said cumulative variables</li>
                <li>There exists a milestone that buffs rhodot or a different cumulative variable</li>
            </ol>
            <p>This principle behind milestone swapping is as such: Milestones that buff growth for cumulative variables can be useds to build up said cumulative
            variable and then respecced to get the bonus of a different variable AND keep the build up of said cumulative variable that was obtained from using
            the milestone previously. This allows you to make use of both milestones.</p>
            <p>The idea is that the benefits of using a cumulative milestone (i.e. high q/r/insert cumulative variable here) remain even after repesccing said
            milestone</p>

            <h2>Nomenclature</h2>
            <p>Milestone swapping is often abbreviated to MS</p>
            <p>Stacking q refers to waiting for q to grow with milestones in q</p>
            <p>Informally written strategies usually use this - after buying \(q_2\) stack q until q triples</p>

            <h2>Example</h2>
            <p>I find an extreme example works best. Let's examine this hypothetical theory:</p>
            <blockquote>\(\dot{\rho} = q\)</blockquote>
            <blockquote>\(\dot{q} = 1\)</blockquote>
            <p>Milestones</p>
            <ol>
                <li>\(\uparrow\) \(\dot{\rho}\) by x1e100</li>
                <li>\(\uparrow\) \(\dot{q}\) by x1e200</li>
            </ol>
            <p>In this example you have only 1 milestone. If you put the milestone into milestone 1, you'd get that x1e100 boost to \(\dot{\rho}\) and reach
            something like 100q for 1e105 \(\rho\)</p>
            <p>If you put the milestone into milestone 2, you'd get that x1e100 boost to \(\dot{q}\) and reach something like 1e202q for about 1e205 \(\rho\)</p>
            <p>So it seems you should use the 2nd milestone. BUT there is another option. If you use the 2nd milestone to get that 1e202q but then SWAP to the
            first milestone, you'd keep the high q AND get the 1e100 boost to \(\rho\) for a total of about 1e305 \(\rho\)</p>
            <p>This is the basis of milestone swapping</p>

            <h2>Case Study: T2</h2>
            <p>Theory 2 is the perfect example of MS Strategies as there are no variable buying strategies and has multiple cumulative variables. Let's recap
            how T2MS works again</p>
            <h4>T2MS</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 (40s)</li>
                <li>3 -> 4 -> 1 -> 2 (10s)</li>
                <li>2 -> 1 -> 3 -> 4 (40s)</li>
                <li>3 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1 (10s)</li>
                <li>Repeat</li>
            </ul>
            <p>For the T2 milestones, 1 boosts q, 2 boosts r, and 3 & 4 boost \(\rho\)</p>
            <p>Milestone strength is 1 > 2 > 3 > 4</p>
            <p>For this strat we are trying to simultaneously increase q, r, and \(\rho\). This is not as simple as our example, as in our example, we'd stack q
            for a bit, and then swap to \(\rho\), preumably before publishing. For this theory, more \(\rho\) allows us to purchase more q and r upgrades,
            giving us a boost to \(\dot{q}\) and \(\dot{r}\) that we need to swap back into to utilise. This strategy starts by building q, than swaps to \(\rho\) to
            make use of the stacked q. Then swap to r, than back to \(\rho\) to make use of it. This cycle is repeated throught, until you finish the publication.</p>
