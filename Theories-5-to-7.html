            <p><i>Previous: <a href="Theories-1-to-4.html">Theory 1 to 4</a></i></p>

            <h2>Synopsis</h2>
            <p>
                I like to think of theories 5 - 8 as the advanced theories, as they can be more complicated then the first 4 (especially t5), though 1 to 4 and 5
                to 8 are grouped together in the guide, so I will do it as well. Except T8, I think it deserves it's own category.</p>

                <p>Anyway, more theories to work through, some harder than others. Have fun!
            </p>

            <!--RUNDOWN-->
            <h2>Rundown</h2>
            <h3>Estimated time: </h3>
            <p>See each individual theory</p>
            <h3>What to do if you're stuck: </h3>
            <p>If you are stuck for more then expected. Are you:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Just starting a theory?</b> When buying a theory, you have to move your students from phi upgrades to the theory. This means that your phi
                    will drop, so it will take a while for the tau to catch back up. This is most noticeable after buying t1</li>
                <li><b>Using the correct milestones?</b> Check out the milestone route for each theory</li>
                <li><b>Publishing at the right times?</b> Most theories you should publish under 20, except T2. The optimal pub multi's are found in each theories section</li>
                <li>Using the correct autoprestige and autosupremacy formula? Using the incorrect autoprestige / supremacy formula can impede progress,
                    so make sure to check. The formulae are <a href="index.html">here</a></li>
                <li>Autosupremacy needs you to do a manual supremacy to get it working. You must re do this manual supremacy every time you open the equation
                    menu. If you could afford some upgrades if you supremacied, you probably need to do a manual supremacy.</li>
                <li>Supermacying in the right places? The general rule of thumb is to supremacy whenever you can afford an upgrade.</li>
                <li>Buying / autobuying all variables/upgrades? With an autobuyer, or the buy all button, you can disable buying certain variables/upgrades,
                    which would definitely impede progress, On that note,</li>
                <li>Using the right student distribution? Use !sigma in the discord server or use
                    <a href="https://conicgames.github.io/exponentialidle/students.html">the student optimiser</a>.
                    Read <a href="IntroToGrad.html">intro to grad</a> for more info</li>
                <li>Graduating in the right places? The full grad route is below</li>
                <li>Asking for help in the discord server? Anything not mentioned here can almost always be answered by the amazing people on the discord
                    server</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Graduation route</h3>
            <p>9k -> 9.4k -> 9.8k -> 10 -> 10.4 -> 10.6k -> 11k -> 12.4k (Skip T8) -> 13.4k -> 14k</p>

            <!--THEORY BASICS-->
            <h2>Theory Basics</h2>
            <p>Publications are equivalent to prestiges for ft, so don't be afraid to use them. For the majority of theories, the optimal pub multi is below 20,
            though it varies by theory the notable exception is t2, which has an optimal pub multi in the thousands</p>

            <p>Each theory provides tau, equal to the maximum rho you have reached. Your total tau is the product of the tau from each theory.
            \(\tau = \tau_1 \times \tau_2...\)</p>

            <p>Each theory has milestones which speed up progress. You can always respec milestones and shuffle them around, so you can experiment as much as
            you wish. Some milestones provide instant benefits, whilst others can take longer the bear fruit. Some milestones are stronger than others</p>

            <p>You do not have to "complete" a theory to move on to the next one, nor do you have to stop a theory when you get all milestones. Play whichever
            theory is fastest</p>

            <h3>How to read the milestone route:</h3>
            <p>The milestone route is a list of distributions, from top to bottom. For example: 0/0/1/0, means you should buy 1 of the 3rd milestone from the
            top. Sometimes, buying milestones unlocks new ones, which can change what is shown. These are presented in a list.</p>

            <p>Here is an example distribution: 0/1/0 -> 1/1/0/0 -> 0/0/3 -> 1/1/0/1 -> 1/1/3/1</p>

            <p>This means you should start by buying the 2nd milestone, then get the first milestone, which unlocks the 4th milestone. Then, when you get 3
            milestones, respec your milestones and put them in the 3rd milestone, later, you should respec those milestones out of the 3rd milestone and put
            them in the 1st, 2nd, and 4th milestones. Finally, the next 3 milestones should go into the 3rd milestone</p>

            <h3>Common strategies:</h3>
            <p>There are some strategies that appear in many/all theories:</p>

            <p>Doubling strats are strats where you hold off buying stepwise variables to save up for more powerful doubling variables, by only buying stepwise
            variables at 10x less than doubling variables. They will usually have a d after their name. For example: t1d is the doubling strat for t1 (used
            only in 0-1e25), where you buy the stepwise variables \(q_1\) and \(c_1\) only when they are 10x lower than the cheapest doubling variable
            (\(min(q_2, c_2)\)) in order to save up for them</p>

            <p>Competing variables is when variables are added up. This means that the lower variable is "weaker" than the higher variable, because increasing
            it has less of an affect. Take this example: \(\dot{ρ} = c_1 + c_2\), where \(c_1\) and \(c_2\) are both doubling variables. If \(c_1 = 10\), and
            \(c_2 = 1\) million, obviously, increasing \(c_1\) to something like 20, even though it's being doubled, has not much of an affect. Therefore, one
            should not buy \(c_1\)</p>

            <h3>Levels of activeness</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Active: Actively playing the game, performing active strats</li>
                <li>Idle: Can check in to publish the theory every so often (best is like 10 - 20 mins but can be longer)</li>
                <li>Overnight: Not checking the game for over many hours</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Note that even though these levels of activeness are given, it is almost always to play a new theory a good amount (~1e100 tau) although if you
            don't reach that when you unlock the next theory MOVE ON</p>
            <p>It as always best to use the <a href="https://tredec.github.io/sim-3.0/">theory simulator</a> to find out what theory to push.</p>

            </ul>
            <h3>T5 overview:</h3>
                <p>T5 is based off of a logistic function. A logistic function is a function that grows slowly at the start, speeds up, and then slows down again
                as it converges to some value, called it's "cap". below is the graph of a logistic function. When the value of the logistic function is far below
                the cap, the growth is exponential, and then as it approaches the cap is slows down exponentially, never quite reaching it</p>

                <img src="images/LogisticFunc.png">

            <h3>Equation Breakdown</h3>
            <blockquote>\(\dot{\rho} = q_1q_2q\)</blockquote>
            <blockquote>\(\dot{q} = (\frac{c_1}{c_2})q(1 - \frac{q}{c_2})\)</blockquote>
            <p>After \(c_3\) unlock</p>
            <blockquote>\(\dot{q} = (\frac{c_1}{c_2})q(c_3 - \frac{q}{c_2})\)</blockquote>
            <p>This first section is a simple equation. Increase \(q_1\), \(q_2\), and \(q\) to increase \(\rho\). The interesting part of these equations is the
            \(\dot{q} = (\frac{c_1}{c_2})q(c_3 - \frac{q}{c_2})\) part. This part can be split into 3 sections that are multiplied together:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>\((\frac{c_1}{c_2})\): This means that increasing c1 increases q growth and increasing c2 decreases q.</li>
                <li>q: This means that increasing q increases qdot. This is the "speeds up in the middle" part of a logistic function. Furthermore, this is
                what makes it look exponential when it is far from the cap, as having the derivative of a function be a proportional to itself is a key property of
                exponential functions</li>
                <li>\(c_3 - \frac{q}{c_2}\): This is the "cap" that q has. As q increases, this section tends towards zero, slowing down q growth,
                and equals zero when \(q = c_2c_3\), stopping q growth, as the 3 terms are multiplied together. Thus q can never increase past \(c_2c_3\), capping
                q.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>From this one can understand what each variable does, and how q works:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>\(q_1\) increases rhodot when bought (~7% increase)</li>
                <li>\(q_2\) doubles rhodot when bought</li>
                <li>\(c_1\) increases q growth speed when bought</li>
                <li>\(c_2\) doubles q cap when bought, but halves q growth speed</li>
                <li>\(c_3\) doubles q cap when bought</li>
            </ul>
            <p>q increases slowly, then speeds up until it reaches (about) half it's cap and then slows down as it approaches it's cap, never surpassing it.</p>
            <p>T5 is also the second fastest theory in endgame</p>

            <h3>Bicycle analogy</h3>

            <p>Written by Playspout</p>
            <p>Think of buy­ing \(c_1\) as throt­tling on the bi­cycle faster. Buy­ing \(c_2\) is sim­ilar to shift­ing the bi­cycle gear up by 1 gear. If all we do is buy
                \(c_1\) and never \(c_2\), then we’re stuck in gear 1 forever and make no pro­gress. However, if all we do is buy \(c_2\) and never \(c_1\), then
                this is sim­ilar to try­ing to ride from highest gear from 0 speed, which we know takes a long time and a lot of ef­fort. There­fore us­ing the bi­cycle
                ana­logy, we should buy \(c_2\) only when we have the speed to sup­port it; not too early and not too late. Fur­ther­more, later in the pub­lic­a­tion, we
                should buy only 1 level of \(c_2\) at a time. We should buy \(c_1\) only right after buy­ing \(c_2\) (shift­ing up gear).When de­cid­ing when to buy
                \(c_1\), \(c_2\), think of \(c_1\) as throt­tling a bi­cycle, and \(c_2\) as shift­ing up gear by 1 level.</p>


            <h3>Optimal publication multiplier:</h3>
                <p>t1's pub multi has no best fit, as it fluctuates a lot, but here is known:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>around 3 until 1e25</li>
                    <li>6 - 10 until max milestones</li>
                    <li>Use the theory sim after that</li>
                </ul>
            <h3>Theory pushing</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Active: T5</li>
                    <li>Idle: T5 EXCEPT recovery must be done active, if in recovery do T34 until 1e150 on both then T2</li>
                    <li>Overnight: T1</li>
                </ul>
            <h3>Strategies:</h3>
                <p>Because of the drawbacks of \(c_2\), T5 benefits the most from active play. Manual \(c_2\) buying is almost mandatory when doing T5</p>
                <p class="important">Warning: do NOT overnight this theory. It has terrible decay past a good pub multi, and will not give good results.</p>
                <p>All strategies revolve around increasing q as fast as possible, with doubling strats for \(q_{12}\). Before learning strats one must understand
                manual \(c_2\) buying during recovery</p>
                <h4>Manual \(c_2\) purchase during recovery</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Autobuy everything except \(c_2\)</li>
                    <li>Set buy amount to x1 or x10 if over 1e150</li>
                    <li>If q is capped (i.e. not changing) buy \(c_2\) (when \(c_2\) purchases slow down set it to x1 if it was set to x10)</li>
                    <li><i>Note: You will have to spam it early in recovery just make sure not to spam it too much</i></li>
                    <li>At e5 from recovery you can safely autobuy \(c_2\)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Remember to untick \(c_2\) autobuy at the end of a publication before you click publish!</p>
                <h4>Alt. Manual \(c_2\) purchase during recovery</h4>
                <p class="important">This strategy is NOT recommended, and may cause this section to last longer than expected</p>
                <p>You can set your buy amount to xmax instead of x1 or x10. This means that after every \(c_2\) purchase, the downside of \(c_2\) will cause
                q to not move for a while. For this strategy, instead of spamming \(c_2\) buy a round of it. Wait a while and buy it again. This means you could
                almost semi-idle it, buy not quite, as it is still pretty active (check every minute)</p>

                <p>After manual buying \(c_2\) there are different strategies for what you do after. This strategies are seperated by activity. T5AI is active,
                T5 idle is (slightly confusingly) semi-idle, and T5 is idle</p>
                <h4>T5AI</h4>

            <h3>T6 overview:</h3>
                <p>T6 is based on the idea of a definite integral. A definite integral finds the area under the graph of an equation from 2 points. Before a new
                dimension is bought, it's finding the area under the graph of a 2d expression (q, f(q)), after it is bought, the graph moves into 3d
                (q, r, f(q,r)).</p>
                <p>For example, let's take the equation f(x) = x. The graph f(x) = x is just a line. The area under the line from 0 to 10 is shown below. The
                integral from 0 to 10 of f(x) is the shaded area in the diagram. That is what an integral is. This can be calculated as a triangle, but there are
                other methods.</p>

            <h3>Equation breakdown</h3>
            <p>Using said other methods, T6's equation can be simplified to the following (remove any terms containing not unlocked variables):</p>
            <blockquote>\(\rho = c_1c_2q + \frac{1}{2}c_3q^2 + \frac{1}{3}c_4q^3 - C\)</blockquote>
            <blockquote>\(\dot{\rho} = c_1c_2\dot{q} + c_3q\dot{q} + c_4q^2\dot{q}\)</blockquote>
            <p>Or after the new dimension milestone</p>
            <blockquote>\(\rho = c_1c_2qr + \frac{1}{2}c_3q^2r + \frac{1}{3}c_4q^3r + \frac{1}{2}c_5qr^2 - C\)</blockquote>
            <blockquote>\(\dot{\rho} = c_1c_2(q\dot{r} + r\dot{q}) + \frac{1}{2}c_3(q^2\dot{r} + 2qr\dot{q}) + \frac{1}{3}c_4(q^3\dot{r} + 3q^2r\dot{q}) + \frac{1}{2}c_5(2qr\dot{r} + r^2\dot{q})\)</blockquote>
            <p>The -C part can be ignored, it's just there to decrease \(\rho\) when you buy an upgrade. </p>

                <li>1e200+: T6noC34d</li>

            <p><i>*note the before 1e7 you will have to buy \(c_{12}\) because you can't afford \(c_3\) </i></p>
            <p><i>** note that before 1e25 you will have to buy \(c_3\) because you cannot afford \(c_4\) </i></p>
            <p>There is a more difficult strategy pot 1e200 called T6AI. However to simplify, I have a strategy I call T6AInoMod (renamed) or T6C5dC12rcv using
            descriptive names. Because it is not in the guide The sim will not recommend this strat, and people may not know it.</p>
            <p>For the relevant idle strategy, simply autobuy all variables that are not listed as "Never Buy"</p>

            <h3>T7 overview:</h3>\
            <p>I have recently learnt how T7 works (thankyou megaminX and 3b1b), and it's really freaking complicated.</p>
            <p>This part is not simple at all. You don't have to read all this, you can just skip to the strategies</p>
            <p>The function \(g(\rho_1, \rho_2)\) is a function that maps every point in \(\rho_1, \rho_2\) space to a number. You can imagine each point in
            \(\rho_1, rho_2\) space, raised to that number. So for example, if g(1,1) = 2, then the point 1, 1 would be raised 2 units up in the 3rd
            dimension. This create a surface in the 3rd dimension, a sort of 2d terrain if you will.</p>
            <p>the \(\nabla\) is the del operator. It is the gradient of the function. You can imagine it like this: Imagine you are standing on a
            point. You look around and you see the terrain around you, and the gradient of the function tell you which way is uphill. Is it in the positive
            x direction? negative y? Some other direction? And it tells you how steep it is. Is it a cliff? or only a gentle incline.</p>
            <p>This information is given as a vector. You can this of a vector as an arrow which is in the same spot you are, pointing uphill, and the bigger the
            arrow the steeper it is.</p>
            <p>and finally we have the equation \(\dot{\rho} = q \nabla g\). This means you look in the direction the arrow is pointing and start walking.
            Your speed depends on q and the size of the vector \(\nabla\) g. As you walk you constantly make adjustments to your speed and directing based on
            the the value of \(\nabla\) g is at you new point.</p>
            <p>A vector can be split up into x and y components, meaning if you walk in the direction of the vector, from the start of the arrow to the end of the
            arrow, you will have moved the vectors x component in the x direction, and the vectors y component in the y direction. In our case, we split it into
            \(\rho_1\) and \(\rho_2\) components</p>
            <p>This is an example of a maximisation algorithm. It moves you to a local maximum, a point where the graph is highest, as you will always move
            upwards</p>
            <p>From now on I will only use \(\rho_1\), \(\rho_2\) coordinates, not x and y.</p>
            <p>\(\rho\) is the point \(\rho_1\), \(\rho_2\), and we will still use "you" as the thing that moving. Just remember it's actually \(\rho\)</p>
            <p>In this example your goal is to maximise \(\rho_1\), to be as far away from the origin in the \(\rho_1\) direction. To do this you want to increase
            both q and the \(\rho_1\) component of \(\nabla\) g. To do this you want to be facing the steepest incline you can facing to the \(\rho_1\)
            direction</p>
            <p>So, block out the \(\rho_2\) direction. You are now on a line. What you want is that when moving forwards, you find yourself moving up a very,
            very steep incline, the steepest you can get. To find this incline you can use differentiation (slightly different from how T2 uses it,
            here the derivative of a function is it's gradient). This allows you to look at a function and a point along the function and can find the
            gradient at a point.</p>
            <p>Right now, we are not moving along \(\rho_2\), so we can treat \(\rho_2\) as a constant. This means that at least in our limited view,
            \(g(\rho_1, \rho_2)\) is just g(\(\rho_1\)). So we take the derivative of g with respect to \(\rho_1\) and we have the \(\rho_1\) direction of our
            \(\nabla\) g vector!</p>
            <p>We can do the same thing for \(\rho_2\) to find the \(\rho_2\) component.</p>

            <h3>What \(\nabla\) does mathematically</h3>
            <p>Assumed knowledge: Basic understanding of vectors and differentiation</p>
            <p>The \(\nabla\) operator is a way of taking the derivative of a multi-variable function. The function \(\nabla\)g is a function that takes in
            the 2 initial arguments \(\rho_1\) and \(\rho_2\) and returns a vector. As shown before this vector is found by looking at each argument individually
            and treating the others as constants. Thus you have the vector \(\begin{bmatrix}dg/d\rho_1\\dg/d\rho_2\end{bmatrix}\).</p>

            <h3>Equation breakdown</h3>
            <p>So finally, here are the simplified equations:</p>
            <blockquote>\(g(\rho_1, \rho_2) = c_1c_2\rho_1 + c_3\rho_1^{1.5} + c_4\rho_2 + c_5\rho_2^{1.5} + c_6\rho_1^{0.5}\rho_2^{0.5} \)</blockquote>
            <blockquote>\(\dot{\rho_1} = c_1c_2 + 1.5c_3\rho_1^{0.5} + c_6\rho_2^{0.5} / 2\rho_1^{0.5} \)</blockquote>
            <blockquote>\(\dot{\rho_2} = c_4 + 1.5c_5\rho_2^{0.5} + c_6\rho_1^{0.5} / 2\rho_2^{0.5} \)</blockquote>

            <h2>Post T7 and T8 skip</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Expected time: 3 - 5 days</li>
                <li>Local Grad Route: 11k -> 12.4k (skip T8) -> 13.4k -> 14k</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Why do we skip T8?</h3>
            <p>T8 is very slow before 1e60, and is thus the ONLY theory where the tau it provides it outweighed by the phi that the 5 students would provide.
            Don't worry, you will still buy T8, just at 14k instead of 12k.</p>
            <p>When T8 is bought, it unlocks another student upgrade: R9, as it is the ninth from the top. When you have 14k, you will be able to afford both T8
            and R9. R9 boosts theory speed, and makes them faster, meaning T8 is worth it</p>
            <p>When you reach 12k, buy T8, swap to it, and then sell it, so you can get the achievement and the 100k stars that come with it. Also, you will be
            able to see R9 (but not buy it)</p>
            <h3>Optimal Theory Distribution for 14k</h3>
            <p>As you push for 14k, you should not only focus on T7. The optimal theory distribution looks like this, so try to focus on theories that are
            lacking:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>T1: e200</li>
                <li>T2: e290</li>
                <li>T3: e130</li>
                <li>T4: e155</li>
                <li>T5: e265</li>
                <li>T6: e165</li>
                <li>T7: e145</li>
                <li>T8: SKIP</li>
            </ul>
            <p>For overnighting use T2 until 1e350 T2 then T6. If your T6 is very high you can start moving to T4</p>
            <p>If your numbers are slightly different that's fine. You just need about e1350 total tau to get to 14k.<br/>
