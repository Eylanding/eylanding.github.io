                In my experience with the exponential idle discord server, I have come across players,
                who, intimidated by the amount of math in the guide, decided to ignore it, or simply,
                could not understand it. Ignoring the guide is obviously a personal decision, but it
                should not be made out of necessity. Furthermore, I have found that much of the guide
                can be at least somewhat confusing to me. So I have decided to try and make a simple
                guide in this website. Maybe if its good enough I'll share it. <s>Only time will tell.</s><br/>
                Oh, I guess I have.
