            <p>
                In my experience with the exponential idle discord server, I have come across players,
                who, intimidated by the amount of math in the guide, decided to ignore it, or simply,
                could not understand it. Ignoring the guide is obviously a personal decision, but it
                should not be made out of necessity. Furthermore, I have found that much of the guide
                can be at least somewhat confusing to me. So I have decided to try and make a simple
                guide in this website. Maybe if its good enough I'll share it. <s>Only time will tell.</s>

            <p>
                Oh, I guess I have.

                Also, I highly recommend everyone to read the actual exponential idle guides:

            <!-- GENERAL GUIDE INFO HERE-->
            <h2>General Guide Info</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    If you notice anything that you don't understand, is hard to understand, something
                    that is wrong, or something you think I can improve, do not hesitate to contact me.
                    Me, and other amazing helpers are on the exponential idle discord server, and always
                    willing to help. If you give me feedback, I will strive to get it simplified/fixed
                    as soon as possible, so that this guide remains as helpful as possible.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Sometimes, knowledge is assumed by the fact that you couldn't have gotten to where you
                    are without it. If you somehow don't have the knowledge (i.e. you are confused about
                    something), check back to previous section, and please tell me so I can add it.
                </li>
                <li>
                    There will be spoilers, so don't read further than you have reached (unless maybe
                    you've unlocked something very early and want to look it up)
                </li>
                <li>
                    The guide's main goal is to be readable to everyone. It is not meant to be a full,
                    in depth look into the game, nor will it provide the best strategies. I highly,
                    HIGHLY, encourage anyone reading this guide to go and read
                    <a href="https://exponential-idle-guides.netlify.app">the real exponential idle guides</a>
                    , written by people a lot more knowledgable than me (i.e. Snaeky).

            <!--STAR INFORMATION-->
            <h2>Stars</h2>
            <p>
                Stars are obtained passively over time.<br/>
                You have a tick star chance, which is the chance you will get a star every tick.<br/>
                This amount starts at 0.04%, and scales with dt. Basically, more dt = more stars.<br/>
                Also, you can play minigames. If you can afford and complete it, hard arrow is the best
                minigame. Furthermore, the achivement for solving the expert arrow puzzles awards 125
                stars, so, after buying the arrow minigame, one can complete expert arrow once and get a full refund.<br/>
                Minigame rewards are also scaled with dt, but it may not be immediately apparent if you
                are at the start of the game, you might need quite a bit of dt for this so start having an affect.

            <!--MAIN EQUATION-->
            <h2>Main Equation Explanation</h2>
            <p>The main equation looks intimidating, but is actually quite simple. Here's the breakdown</p>
            <p>\(f(t+dt) = f(t) \times e^{bxdt}\)<br/>
                (for post 2k equation refer to intro to grad)<br/>
                <br/>
                Essentially, it means that every second, your current f(t) is multiplied by \(e^{bxdt}\), where e is eulers number (1.71828)</p>
            <p>For example, if your b and dt are 1, and your f(t) and x are 2, then on the next time step, your f(t) of 1 will increase by a
                factor of \(e ^ {bxdt} = e ^ {1\times2\times1} = e^2\), which is approximately 7.39. So afterwards, your f(t) will be multiplied by 7.39. 2 * 7.29
                is approximately 14.54, so after 1 second your ft will have increased from 2 to 14.5</p>
            <p>This repeated multiplication means your ft will increase exponentially (going faster) over time. This means that the number after
                1 e will appear to grow linearly (a constant speed) and the number after ee will appear to grow logarithmically (slowing down).</p>
            <p>Note that because of this, a more reasonable way of doing costs is by dividing instead of subtracting. For example, if you have 1000 f(t)
                and buy something that costs 100 ft, afterwords you will have 10 ft, not 900.</p>

            <!--AUTOPRESTIGE AND AUTOSUPREMACY-->
            <h2>Autoprestige & Autosupremacy Formulae</h2>
            <p><i>If you don't know what this is ignore pls</i></p>
            <p>Autoprestige:</p>

            <blockquote>((timer(pt * d(ln(ln(db / b + 1))) &lt 1)> 3 * tr && db > b &&((d(smooth(10^10^10^(phi * tau), 1))
            > 1)&& timer(abs(d(log10(phi + 1))) &lt 50) > 15))&& phi > 1) ||((timer(pt * d(ln(ln(db / b + 1)))
            &lt 1)> 3 * tr) && db > b &&((phi >= 1 && phi %lt= 1) ||((0.8 * log10(log10(lf)) > log10(log10(gf)))
            ||(0.8 * log10(log10(gf)) > log10(log10(sf))))))</blockquote>

            <p>(for more info please read progress ee50 to ee200)</p>

            <p>Autosupremacy: </p>

            <blockquote>(d(ln(db / b + 1) / pt) &lt 0)> 3 * tr && db > b&& dpsi + psi > min(min(costUpS(1),costUpS(2)),
            costUpS(3))&& ln(1 + max(1, log10(sf)) /smooth(max(1, log10(gf)),(st > tr) * ee99)) / max(1, st)
            &ltsmooth(ln(1 + max(1, log10(sf)) /smooth(max(1, log10(gf)), (st > tr)* ee99)) / max(1, st), (pt >
            tr) * ee99)</blockquote>

            <p>Remember to set your mode to equation</p>
            <p class="important"><b>IMPORTANT! After you input this, do a manual supremacy. Anytime you enter the edit expression field
                (the place where you put this in) you have to do another manual supremacy or this will break</b><br/>
                Also, you have to have you autobuyers set to x1 or xMax</p>
