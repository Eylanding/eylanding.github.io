            <h2>Graduation routing past ee20k</h2>
            <p>There are no set grad routes past ee20k</p>
            <p>The graduation calculator is a great tool to be able to find your next grad point. To use this tool, enter your phi and tau, and it will give you 
            our next grad point. When you reach that grad point, enter the information again. It will give you a new grad point. Continue this until the
            calculator gives you your correct ft. That's where you should grad</p>
            <p>If you overshoot your grad point the grad calc will often tell you to go to the next one, and the next one, over and over. The grad calc is not
            perfect. Use common sense as well</p>
            <p>At later ft's (50k+) the grad calc loses accuracy. At ft's like those, you have to estimate good grad marks yourself. Using the student calculator
            can help you calculate bigmas and skipmas. Try to grad on bigmas and not on skipmas</p>
            <p>A guide on how to use the grad calc is
            <a href="https://exponential-idle-guides.netlify.app/guides/endgame/#how-to-properly-use-the-graduation-calculator">here</a></p>

            <h2>Bigmas and Skipmas</h2>
            <p>A bigma is a student that provides more phi then usual, usually over 1e9 more phi.</p>
            <p>A skipma is a student that provides no extra phi</p>
            <p>When deciding when to graduate, calculate your optimal student distribution with the amount of students you would have after a graduation.
            Then calculate 1 minus that amount. If the values are far apart (usually over 1e9) you are on a bigma. If the amount doesn't change, meaning you have
            unspent students in the optimal theory distribution, you are on a skipma</p>
            <h3>Skipma list</h3>
            <p>Here is a list of skipmas:</p>
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <td>Always skipped</td>
                    <td>29.8k, 30.2k, 30.8k, 31.4k, 32.0k, 32.6k, 33.2k, 33.8k, 34.2k, 34.6k, 35.4k, 36.2k, 37.0k, 37.8k, 38.6k, 39.0k, 39.6k, 40.6k, 41.6k,

                    <td>64.6k</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            <p>Past 70k you will need to calculate skipmsa yourself</p>


            <h2>Supremacy equations past 48k</h2>
            <p>Bet you didn't think you'd see this here! After getting all supremacy upgrades, the supremacy formulae changes. These new formulae do not require
            a manual supremacy. They are:</p>
            <p><b>Past 48k</b></p>
            <blockquote>costUpS(1)&lte52&&psi+dpsi>e52)||(costUpS(3)&lte411&&psi+dpsi>e411)||(costUpS(3)&lte511&&psi+dpsi>e511)||(costUpS(3)&lte531&&psi+dpsi>e531)
            ||(costUpS(3)&lte551&&psi+dpsi>e551)||(costUpS(3)&lte571&&psi+dpsi>e571)</blockquote>
            <p><b>Past 52k:</b></p>
            <blockquote>(costUpS(1)&lte52&&psi+dpsi>e52)||(costUpS(3)&lte511&&psi+dpsi>e511)||(costUpS(3)&lte571&&psi+dpsi>e571)</blockquote>
            <p><b>Past  58k - 60k:</b></p>
            <blockquote>(costUpS(1)&lte52&&psi+dpsi>e52)||(costUpS(3)&lte571&&psi+dpsi>e571)</blockquote>


            <h2>Distribution Overpushing</h2>
            <p>You goal is to get the maximum tau as fast as possible. Before R9, it didn't matter what order you push theories in, pushing T2 to 1e100 and then
            pushing T5 to 1e100 thkes the same time, however, now that R9 boosts theories based on students, to maximise taudot you have to push theories as fast
            as you can to get R9 quickly.</p>
            <p>Therefore, the greedy way to push theories is obvious, push the fastest theory to get more R9. This is immediately obvious and is not that bad</p>
            <p>However, there is another way. R9 affects all theories differently. It affects some theories more then others. This means that the greedy way is
            not actually the best way to push theories. This is called <b>overpushing</b>. </p>
            <p>2 initial points for distribution overpushing</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Pushing a theory later is faster than pushing the theory now, because you will have more students later which means more R9 boost</li>
                <li>R9 effects different theories differently. For example, R9 effects T5 10x more than it affects T2.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>So, if we pushed T5 now, it would be inefficient, because we could have pushed T5 later and gotten more speed. Pushing T2 now is still worse than
            pushing it later, but because it is effected so little by R9, the difference is smaller. So you should push T2 now and T5 later</p>
            <p>Example:</p>
            <table>
                <tr><th>Theory</th><th>Now              </th><th>Later             </th></tr>
                <tr><td>T2    </td><td>0.1 \(\tau\)/h</td><td>0.11 \(\tau\)/h</td></tr>
                <tr><td>T5    </td><td>0.1 \(\tau\)/h</td><td>0.2 \(\tau\)/h </td></tr>
            </table>
            <p>Option 1: T2 now, T5 later<br/>
            Rates: 0.1 for T2 and 0.2 for T5. average is 0.15</p>
            <p>Option 2: T5 now, T2 later<br/>
            Rates: 0.11 for T2 and 0.1 for T5. average is 0.105</p>
            <p>Pushing some combination of T2 and T5 just puts you somewhere between these 2 values, thus you should push T2 now and T5 later.</p>
            <p>Note that this isn't always true, eventually T2 will get so slow that it's actually better to do T5, because T2 just takes ages and you'll get
            nowhere, therefore, there are specific ratio's for each theory depending on how much they are affected by R9. Therefore, we have created ratios to 
            tell you how much you should overpush each theory</p>
            <p>The overpushing ratios are as follows</p>
            <ul>
                <li>T1: 1</li>
                <li>T2: 10.2</li>
                <li>T3: 1</li>
                <li>T4: 1.5</li>
                <li>T5: 1</li>
                <li>T6: 3</li>
                <li>T7: 1</li>
                <li>T8: 1</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You should push the theory which has the highest \(\tau\)/h * ratio</p>
            <h3>Cashing in</h3>
            <p>A way to describe distribution overpushing is that overpushing "stores energy". Short term, distribution overpushing is terrible, as it just
            means you are pushing the wrong theory. Thus distribution overpushing "stores energy" that is used later. However, this is only good if you do use it
            later. As you get further into the game, the time it takes gets ridiculous, and you may want to cash in all that stored energy.</p>
            <p>Cashing in refers to switching from distribution overpushing to pushing theories the greedy way. This is faster short term, but slower long term, 
            however, the are more scenarios you'd want to do it:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>If you are planning on quitting exponential idle (don't do that!)</li>
                <li>If you are going for leaderboard positions, cashing in can get you high spots quickly</li>
                <li>Cashing in is not instant, and lategame it can take years to fully cash in. For example, for the top players who are overpushing, it could
                take up to 5 years to fully cash in. At this point, cashing in is probably the best option. This happens before that point too. Perfect ratios
                at 80k ft can take up to a year to cash in</li>
            </ol>

            <p>After 1e275 the best strategy if T4d66noMod:</p>
            <p>The pub multi for T4d66noMod is 3.5 - 4.5</p>

            <h3>T5</h3>
            <p>With T5, the best strat is always T5AI</p>

            <h3>T6</h3>
            <p>T6noC34d (or T6AInoMod) is the best strat from here on out, except for T6AI which is described 
            <a href="https://exponential-idle-guides.netlify.app/guides/theory-strategies/#t6ai">here</a></p>

            <h3>T7</h3>
            <p>after e300 you should do T7Playspqcey, which is equivalent to T7Playspqceyinfinity or the following chart:</p>
            <h4>T7PlaySpqcey</h4>
            <table>

            <h3>T8</h3>
            <p>There is a more advanced strat for T8 known as T8Solarswap which is found
