            <h2>Synopsis</h2>
            <p>
                This is where the game gets interesting. Starting for 5k, every thousand ft you will unlock another theory. Unlike the main equation, setting
                theories to sit on full autobuy is usually and bad idea, and one always has to decide which theory to do. I find theories are the most fun part of
                the game.<br/>
                Theories all vary from one another, with each theory having different strategies, and are based of different mathematical ideas.
            </p>

            <h2>Rundown</h2>
            <h3>Estimated time: </h3>
            <p>See each individual theory</p>
            <h3>What to do if you're stuck: </h3>
            <p>If you are stuck for more then expected. Are you:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Just starting a theory?</b> When buying a theory, you have to move your students from phi upgrades to the theory. This means that your phi
                    will drop, so it will take a while for the tau to catch back up. This is most noticeable after buying t1</li>
                <li><b>Using the correct milestones?</b> Check out the milestone route for each theory</li>
                <li><b>Publishing at the right times?</b> Most theories you should publish under 20, except T2. The optimal pub multi's are found in each theories section</li>
                <li>Using the correct autoprestige and autosupremacy formula? Using the incorrect autoprestige / supremacy formula can impede progress,
                    so make sure to check. The formulae are <a href="index.html">here</a></li>
                <li>Autosupremacy needs you to do a manual supremacy to get it working. You must re do this manual supremacy every time you open the equation
                    menu. If you could afford some upgrades if you supremacied, you probably need to do a manual supremacy.</li>
                <li>Supermacying in the right places? The general rule of thumb is to supremacy whenever you can afford an upgrade.</li>
                <li>Buying / autobuying all variables/upgrades? With an autobuyer, or the buy all button, you can disable buying certain variables/upgrades,
                    which would definitely impede progress, On that note,</li>
                <li>Using the right student distribution? Use !sigma in the discord server or use
                    <a href="https://conicgames.github.io/exponentialidle/students.html">the student optimiser</a>.
                    Read <a href="IntroToGrad.html">intro to grad</a> for more info</li>
                <li>Graduating in the right places? The full grad route is below</li>
                <li>Asking for help in the discord server? Anything not mentioned here can almost always be answered by the amazing people on the discord

            <h3>Graduation route</h3>
            <p>5k -> 5.2k -> 5.6k -> 5.8k -> 6k -> 7k -> 8k -> 8.4k -> 8.6k -> 8.8k -> 9k</p>

            <!--THEORY BASICS-->
            <h2>Theory Basics</h2>
            <p>Publications are equivalent to prestiges for ft, so don't be afraid to use them. For the majority of theories, the optimal pub multi is below 20,
            though it varies by theory the notable exception is t2, which has an optimal pub multi in the thousands</p>

            <p>Each theory provides tau, equal to the maximum rho you have reached. Your total tau is the product of the tau from each theory.
            \(\tau = \tau_1 \times \tau_2...\)</p>

            <p>Each theory has milestones which speed up progress. You can always respec milestones and shuffle them around, so you can experiment as much as
            you wish. Some milestones provide instant benefits, whilst others can take longer the bear fruit. Some milestones are stronger than others</p>

            <h3>How to read the milestone route:</h3>
            <p>The milestone route is a list of distributions, from top to bottom. For example: 0/0/1/0, means you should buy 1 of the 3rd milestone from the
            top. Sometimes, buying milestones unlocks new ones, which can change what is shown. These are presented in a list.</p>

            <p>Here is an example distribution: 0/1/0 -> 1/1/0/0 -> 0/0/3 -> 1/1/0/1 -> 1/1/3/1</p>

            <p>This means you should start by buying the 2nd milestone, then get the first milestone, which unlockes the 4th milestone. Then, when you get 3
            milestones, respec your milestones and put them in the 3rd milestone, later, you should respec those milestones out of the 3rd milestone and put
            them in the 1st, 2nd, and 4th milestones. Finally, the next 3 milestones should go into the 3rd milestone</p>

            <h3>Common strategies:</h3>
            <p>There are some strategies that appear in many/all theories:</p>

            <p>Doubling strats are strats where you hold off buying stepwise variables to save up for more powerful doubling variables, by only buying stepwise
            variables at 10x less than doubling variables. They will usually have a d after their name. For example: t1d is the doubling strat for t1 (used
            only in 0-1e25), where you buy the stepwise variables \(q_1\) and \(c_1\) only when they are 10x lower than the cheapest doubling variable
            (\(min(q_2, c_2)\)) in order to save up for them</p>

            <p>Competing variables is when variables are added up. This means that the lower variable is "weaker" than the higher variable, because increasing
            it has less of an affect. Take this example: \(\dot{ρ} = c_1 + c_2\), where \(c_1\) and \(c_2\) are both doubling variables. If \(c_1 = 10\), and
            \(c_2 = 1\) million, obviously, increasing \(c_1\) to something like 20, even though it's being doubled, has not much of an affect. Therefore, one
            should not buy \(c_1\)</p>

            <h3>Other:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>I'm calculating what my ρdot should be and it's not matching up! Remember, you have to include your pub multi in this calculation</li>
                    <li>What does \(\dot{\rho}\) mean? Explained in T2 overview, even though it's briefly in T1, \(\rho\) increases by \(\dot{\rho}\) every
                        second</li>
                </ul>

            <!--RECURRANCE RELATIONS-->
            <h2>Theory 1: Reccurance Relations</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Expected time:</b> 2 - 6 days</li>
                <li><b>Local Grad Route:</b> 5k -> 5.2k -> 5.6k -> 5.8k -> 6k</li>
                <li><b>Stuck?</b> Read the General Info</li>
                <li><b>Milestone route:</b> 0/0/1 -> 0/0/1/1 -> 0/1/1/1 -> 3/1/1/1</li>
                <li><b>One sentence description:</b> \(\rho\) impacts \(\dot{\rho}\), so don't be too hasty to buy things!</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>T1 overview:</h3>
                <p><i style="font-size: 5;">Note: Most of the time in this game, when this guide refers to ticks, It means 0.1 seconds. However, in t1 it is different, as the tickspeed of
                t1 is controlled by \(q_1q_2\). Therefore, in the guide, 1 tick in T1 is equal to \(\frac{1}{q_1q_2}\) seconds, and even though the actual
                game still actually only performs 10 ticks per second, this should not make any noticeable difference.</i></p>

                <p>A recurrence relation is an equation that takes an initial term and changes it to get the next term. For example, take the following recurrence relation
                as an example: \(\rho_n = \rho_{n-1}+1\). Lets say \(\rho_0 = 0\). Thus \(\rho_1 = \rho_{1-1} + 1 = \rho_0 + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1\). And then \(\rho_2 = \rho_1
                + 1 = 2\), and so on.</p>

                <p>The theory works the same way. Every second, n increases by \(q_1q_2\)  (thats what the tickspeed means), and \(\rho_n\) is \(c_1c_2\) + ... greater than
                the previous (\(\rho_{n-1}\)).</p>

                <p>You can think of it like this: every second, \(\rho\) increases by \(q_1q_2\) times everything on the right of \(\rho_{n-1}\). So, without any
                milestones, \(\rho\) increases by \(q_1q_2c_1c_2 (\times p_{ubmulti})\) every second.</p>

                <p>After getting a few milestones, you may notice that your current value of \(\rho\) is in the bit that tells you how much \(\rho\) is going to increase.
                (for example, the \(c_3 \rho_{n-2}^{0.3}\)) This means the current* value of rho impacts how much it is going to increase in the next
                second/tick.</p>

                <p><i>*it's actually the value of \(\rho\) 2 ticks or \(\frac{1}{q_1q_2}\) seconds ago, but it shouldn't matter</i></p>
            <h3>Optimal publication multiplier:</h3>
                <p>t1's pub multi has no best fit, as it fluctuates alot, but here is known:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>4 - 6 to start</li>
                    <li>3 - 4 between e100 and e150</li>
                    <li>Oscillates between 2.5 and 5 past e150</li>
                </ul>
            <h3>Theory pushing</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Active: T1</li>
                    <li>Idle: T1</li>
                    <li>Overnight: T1</li>
                </ul>
            <h3>Strategies:</h3>
                <p>Before the first milestone the strategy is simple doubling strats, as the equation here is almost the simplest possible:
                \(\dot{\rho} = q_1q_2c_1c_2\).<br/>
                0 - e25 strats:</p>
                <table>
                    <tr><th>T1d    </th><th>                                            </th></tr>
                    <tr><td>\(q_1\)</td><td>Cost is 10x less than \(min(q_2, c_2)\) cost</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>\(q_2\)</td><td style="color: green;">Always Buy          </td></tr>
                    <tr><td>\(c_1\)</td><td>Cost is 10x less than \(min(q_2, c_2)\) cost</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>\(c_2\)</td><td style="color: green;">Always Buy          </td></tr>
                </table>
                <p>
                After unlocking the term \(c_3\rho{n-2}^{0.3}\), the theory becomes more interesting. because \(\dot{\rho}\) is based on the current value of 
                \(\rho\), buying upgrades immediately means you actually will, for a bit, make you slower, which you don't want. Therefore, you want to wait 
                before buying upgrades.<br/>
                That is the basis of the strat t1Ratio, where you buy upgrades at a ratio to ρ.
                </p>



            <h3>Other miscellaneous info</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>When saving up for a star upgrade, remember you can buy and sell anything at anytime so don't let your stars go unused! Buy permanent levels
                        while your waiting, and than sell them to buy the thing you're saving up for</li>
                    <li>What permanent levels should I buy?<br/>If you have all the variables bought, use the star calculator
                        <a href="https://conicgames.github.io/exponentialidle/stars.html">here</a>. Alternatively press the i button (next to the word "variables")
                        to see how much power each of your variables contributes, and put your stars in the strongest one (don't worry if there's a couple left
                        over)</li>
                </ul>
