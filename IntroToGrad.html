            <h2>Synopsis</h2>
            <p>This page of the guide is your go to explanation page for graduating, research upgrades and phi. However it does NOT include R9,
            which is explained later. Graduation and students can be tricky at first, however, it is simply another level of prestige.</p>

            <h2>PLEASE READ <a href="index.html">GENERAL GUIDE</a> PAGE BEFORE READING THIS</h2>
            <p><i>

            <!--Nomenclature-->
            <h2>Nomenclature used here</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>phi</b> is the nw symbol added to the equation. See <i>fig 1</i>. This website does not support that type of phi, so phi will instead
                    be displayed as \(\phi\)</li>
                    <li><b>Research upgrades</b> are the upgrades in the graduation menu that costs students, they are numbered from top to bottom</li>
                    <li>\(R_n\) or Rn means research upgrade n. this is from top to bottom, so \(R_1\) (or R1) would mean research upgrade 1, which is the one that says \(\phi_1 = dt^n\)</li>
                </ul>

            <!--FAQ-->
            <h2>FAQ</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>What is the star symbol in R3? It means total stars, including spent ones</li>
                    <li>What upgrades should I buy? Read below, but, if in doubt, use the student calculator</li>
                    <li>Can I respec my research upgrades? Yes.</li>
                </ul>

            <!--Graduation equation explanation-->
            <h2>Graduation equation explanation</h2>
                <p>Just like the main equation, it looks intimidating but isn't that difficult. The \(\Pi\) notation means product and is like sigma \(\Sigma\)
                notation but for multiplication. For those who don't know what I'm talking about what the equation means is this:<br/>
                \(\phi = \phi_1 \times \phi_2 \times \phi_3 ...\)</p>

                <p>Basically, your main phi, the one in the main equation is equal to all the other phi's multiplied together. For example, if your \(\phi_1\) was 6
                and by \(\phi_2\) was 7 and all your other \(\phi\)'s were 1 (1 is the minimum), your total or main \(\phi\) would be 42</p>

                <p>Because of properties of exponents, the multiplication is very simple. This property is \(10^a \times 10^b = 10^{a+b}\). For example, \(1e10
                \times 1e20 = 1e30\). This effectively turns the multiplication into addition.</p>

                <p>For example, if your \(\phi_1\) was 3e7 and your \(\phi_2\) was 2e8 (and the rest are 1) your total/main phi would be \((3\times2)e(7+8) = 6e13\)</p>

            <!--NEW MAIN EQ-->
            <h2>New main equation explanation</h2>
                <p>The equation has changed from \(f(t+dt) = f(t) \times e ^ {bxdt}\) to \(f(t+dt) = f(t) \times e ^ {bx\phi\tau dt}\).</p>

                <p>You get \(\phi\) from buying research upgrades</p>

                <p>\(\tau\) is unlocked at 5k f(t)</p>

            <!--STUDENT OPTIMISATION-->
            <h2>What research upgrades should I buy?</h2>
                <p>Note: There are some pre-set distributions in the progress sections, so check there for some quick distribution (though may not be 100% optimal</p>

                <p>Just like the variables and upgrades in the main equation, use can use the little i button to look at how much phi each upgrade gives you, and
                how much power it has. You can use this to pick the upgrades that give the best phi/student. Note, that costs increase as you purchase more of
                them, so you're looking for best phi/student, not just best phi.</p>

                <p>Remember, you can respec your student upgrades so don't be afraid to experiment</p>

                <p>The star is R3 is your total stars, including spent ones</p>

            <!--GRAD ROUTES-->
            <h2>What are these "grad routes"?</h2>
                <p>Graduation routs, or grad routes for short, tell you when, optimally to graduate. This is shown in f(t). For example, if the graduation route
                tells you to grad at 4k f(t), than once you reach 4k ft, grad.</p>

                <p>Graduation routs are written in an arrow notation, with each grad as a number. For example:<br/>
                2k -> 4k -> 4.8k -> 5k<br/>
                means to graduate when your f(t) is 2k, than 4k, than 4.8k, than 5k</p>

            <!--AUTORPETIGE-->
            <h2>Auto-prestige</h2>
                <p>There are 2 autoprestige formulae. This first one works for progress 0 to ee2000, and the second one works for all stages of the game. At this
                point you should use the second one if you aren't already</p>

                <p><u>Formula 2</u>
                
                <blockquote>((timer(pt * d(ln(ln(db / b + 1))) &lt 1)> 3 * tr && db > b &&((d(smooth(10^10^10^(phi * tau), 1)) > 1)&& timer(abs(d(log10(phi + 1))) &lt 50) > 15))
                    && phi > 1) ||((timer(pt * d(ln(ln(db / b + 1))) &lt 1)> 3 * tr) && db > b &&((phi >= 1 && phi &lt= 1) ||((0.8 * log10(log10(lf)) > log10(log10(gf)))
                    ||(0.8 * log10(log10(gf)) > log10(log10(sf))))))</blockquote>

                <p>Autoprestige explanation in the actual guide:<br/>
                <a href="https://exponential-idle-guides.netlify.app/guides/ex-basics/#autoprestige-explanation">Formula 1</a><br/>
                <a href="https://exponential-idle-guides.netlify.app/guides/intro-to-grad/#autoprestige-explanation">Formula 2
                (builds off formula one so read that first)</a></p>

            <!--STUDENT CALC-->
            <h2>Student calculator, and how to use and read it</h2>
                <p>Just like organising your star upgrades, you can organise your student upgrades. The use the student calculator, use !!sigma in the #bot-commands
                channel in the exponential idle discord server, or use the one online
                <a href="https://conicgames.github.io/exponentialidle/students.html">here</a>. This will give you the most optimal star distribution.</p>

                <p>To use the student calculator, enter your current values of: students (not in theories), t, and ft, and your total stars, including spent ones.
                (also ad bonus and accel but those are pretty self explanatory.) If these values are changing too rapidly, now is not the time to use the student
                calculator, wait a bit until it settles. You should do student calculations regularly, one per graduation and once every few hundred ft's if anything
                has changed.</p>

                <p>The student calculator outputs some info, as well as a student distribution, as a list of numbers. For example, consider the list 2, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0.
                This means to put 2 levels in R1, 2 levels in R2, 1 level in R3, and no students in the rest. The seven numbers correspond to upgrades 1 through 7.
                You should always have R8 (theories) at the maximum you can get it, exception at ee12k ft.</p>

                <p>If you can't afford R8 and don't know what theories are, don't worry, they're post 5k (unless you are post 5k in which case, buy theories now!!!)</p>

            <!--MISC-->
            <h2>Other Miscellaneous Info</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Turn off autoprestige at ee5 below a graduation point. As this point it's faster to push than recover. However, never turn of autobuyers.
                        Graduations are based of graduation ft, which doesn't decrease when you buy variables or upgrades.</li>
                </ul>
