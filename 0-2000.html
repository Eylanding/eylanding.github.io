            <h2>Synopsis</h2>
            <p>
                This part is an introduction to the game. The beginning is fairly active as you don't have much automation,
                so one has to focus on buying these upgrades manually. After that however, it gets increasingly idle.<br\>
                Working through this area of the game should be relatively simple, and there aren't many things you can do
                to significantly slow down or speed up your game, though I'm sure the "What to do if you're stuck" section
                will help at least one person who doesn't know what upgrades are. <br/>
                Have fun!
            </p>
