            <h2>Synopsis</h2>
            <p>
                This part is an introduction to the game. The beginning is fairly active as you don't have much automation,
                so one has to focus on buying these upgrades manually. After that however, it gets increasingly idle.<br\>
                Working through this area of the game should be relatively simple, and there aren't many things you can do
                to significantly slow down or speed up your game, though I'm sure the "What to do if you're stuck" section
                will help at least one person who doesn't know what upgrades are. <br/>
                Have fun!
            </p>

            <h2>Rundown</h2>
                <h3>Estimated time: </h3>
                    <p>A few days to a week</p>
                <h3>What to do if you're stuck: </h3>
                    <p>If you are stuck for more then a few days you are probably going something wrong. Are you:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Prestiging in the right places? Don't be afraid to use prestiges, they are a necessary part of the game</li>
                        <li>Supermacying in the right places? The general rule of thumb is to supremacy whenever you can afford an upgrade.</li>
                        <li>Using the correct autoprestige / autosupremacy formula? Using incorrect formula can impede progress, so make sure to check.
                            Read below for autoprestige and auto supremacy information</li>
                        <li>Using a faulty autosupremacy? Remember, after anytime you enter the edit equation screen (the place you put your auto-supremacy
                            equation into), you have to do a manual supremacy again. If you're unsure, and your autosupremacy seems to not be working, just
                            do a manual supremacy</li>
                        <li>Buying / autobuying all variables/upgrades? With an autobuyer, or the buy all button, you can disable buying certain variables/upgrades,
                            which would definitely impede progress, On that note,</li>
                        <li>Buying upgrades? Some people don't see the upgrades menu. Press the word "variables" on the main equation screen. This will turn
                            your variable buy screen into the upgrade buy screen. Press upgrades to switch back. Not buying upgrades makes this section pretty
                            much impossible</li>
                        <li>Asking for help in the discord server? Anything not mentioned here can almost always be answered by the amazing people on the discord
                            server</li>
                    </ul>
                <h3>Other miscellaneous info</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Accel: It's hugely powerful when you do use it, boosting dt which makes f(t) and stars grow faster, as well as possibly inceasing your
                        minigame star reward amount, but if you don't use it, don't buy it (or sell it if you've already bought it). It provides no bonus unless
                        you're holding it down, and 50 stars can be used for other things (but if you have enough stars, you can buy it anyways)</li>
                    <li>Equation taps. Each equation tap  increases t by 1, immediately jumping forward through time a bit (1 / dt seconds)* and progressing you.
                        This is a significant boost until around ee15 to ee20, Afterwords, your dt gets large enough that equation taps do mostly nothing.<br/>
                        <i>*This is because dt gets stronger and stronger, which outpaces your equation taps, which is why they become weaker. t naturally increases
                            by dt every second, so increasing t by 1 has a weaker and weaker affect as t growth gets faster and faster</i></li>
            </ul>

                <h3>When should I prestige?</h3>
                <p>
                    Determining when to prestige is based on db/b growth. How much higher is db compared to b? 10x, 100x, 1 million x? If the amount this is growing
                    is slowing down drastically, you are probably at the end of a prestige, and should consider prestiging<br\>
                    There is a more in depth look in the
                    <a href="https://exponential-idle-guides.netlify.app/guides/1-ee2k/#prestige-strategy-before-autoprestige">guide.</a><br/>
                    This includes an optional look at dmu growth, and can make your prestiges more efficient<br\>
                </p>
                <h3>Stars</h3>
                    <p>When spending stars, what you should buy, from highest priority to lowest is:<br/>
                    accel (if you use it) > autobuyers = variable > automations speed >>> permanent levels.<br/>
                    Variable vs Autobuyer priority is affected by how active you are but I weight them the same</p>

                    <p>When saving up for a star upgrade, remember you can buy and sell anything at anytime so don't let your stars go unused! Buy permanent levels
                    while your waiting, and than sell them to buy the thing you're saving up for.</p>

                    <p>With permanent levels, you want to use the i button to see which variable has the highest power. Put all your stars into that variable. If you
                    want, with leftover stars, you can put that into your second best variable.</p>

                    <p>This is not optimal but is simple. for a better strat, if you have all the variables, you can use the star calculator 
                    <a href="https://conicgames.github.io/exponentialidle/stars.html">here</a>, if you don't, <s>consult the guide</s> actually,
                    I couldn't find anything about it on the guide, so you should ask on the discord server or use the (i) strat mentioned above</p>
                <h3>Minigames</h3>
                    <p>Minigames provide stars when completed. Read <a href="https://exponential-idle-guides.netlify.app/guides/asd/">here</a> for how to solve them</p>

                    <p>Minigames are completely optional. It is possible to get through the entire game without them. However, the extra stars can really make you
                    faster</p>
                        
                    <p>If you are mostly idle, the best strat is to not buy them. Minigames only provide rewards when played, and cost stars to purchase</p>
                        
                    <p>If you are active, your priority is to play the 15 puzzle to get stars to buy and solve the arrow puzzle. a few games of hard arrow or 1 game
                    of expert will earn you a full refund. This can get you more stars which means more variables, for more speed. If you get auto-prestige, the
                    section about auto-prestige is in the next section.</p>

                    <p>With harrow, usually the first few times you solve you may run into some problems (it took me like 7 tries to solve my first one!) but practice
                    makes perfect so just keep at it.</p>

            <!-- ee50 - ee200 -->
            <h2>Progress ee50 - ee200</h2>

                <h3>Auto-prestige</h3>

                    <p>Autoprestige is a powerful tool that can do prestiges for you with perfect precision, no matter if you're online or offline. Buying auto-prestige
                    is of high value, although selling variables for it is a bad idea. There are 2 autoprestige formulae. This first one works for progress 0 to
                    ee2000, and the second one works for all stages of the game. Right now you can use either, but you probably want to use the second one, so you
                    don't have to switch later. To use these formula, set autoprestige to equation mode (tap the "mode button")</p>

                    <p><u>Formula 1</u></p>

                    <blockquote>timer(d(ln(db/b+1)/pt) &lt 0)> 3 * tr && db > b</blockquote>

                    && phi > 1) ||((timer(pt * d(ln(ln(db / b + 1))) &lt 1)> 3 * tr) && db > b &&((phi >= 1 && phi &lt= 1) ||((0.8 * log10(log10(lf)) > log10(log10(gf)))

                <h3>Supremacy</h3>
                    <p>Supremacy is the 2nd level of prestige. It resets all normal and prestige upgrades for some psi. psi does NOT give any boost by itself, it is just
                    a currency. Therefore there is almost no reason to supremacy when you can't afford something with your psi. There are exceptions. For example,
                    there is an upgrade that costs 1000 psi. It is actually more efficient to do 2 supremacies at 500 dpsi each to get the 1000 required psi.</p>

                    <p class="important"><b>Important!</b> If you are ever wondering when you supremacy, the rule of thumb is whenever you would be able to afford a new upgrade with the dpsi you
                    get. This applies the moment you unlock it. Upon reaching ee50, you should immediately supremacy.</p>

                    <p>There is an exception to the rule. When you reach ee200, you will be forced to supremacy whether you want to or not. Thus, for what should be your
                    third supremacy at f(t) = ee140, to afford \(y ^ {1.6}\), you should instead wait till you have to do a supremacy at ee200</p>

                        This costs an enormous amount of stars. So do not fret if you don't get it here. You are expected to get it in the next section. That said, if you
                        do get it here, here it is!
