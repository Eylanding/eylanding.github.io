            <h2>Synopsis</h2>
            <p>
                This stage of the game is also relatively idle, especially once autosupremacy is unlocked. The interesting part here is graduation routing and
                student distributions, which are already optimised to oblivion.<br/><br/>
                This part also has the infamous timewall, the 5k push at the end. Be prepared for a long push.<br/><br/>
                Other than that, not much to do here, but it's only gonna get more complicated form here on out.<br/><br/>
            </p>

            <h2>PLEASE READ <a href="index.html">GENERAL GUIDE</a> PAGE BEFORE READING THIS</h2>
            <p><i>
                Disclaimer: This is a simplified version of the guide. The guide will skip over things, and is not completely
                optimal. Click <a href="https://exponential-idle-guides.netlify.app/">here</a> for a more polished, in-depth, and optimal guide.

                Note: I find the actual guide does quite well at this, and is very simple, probably better than this one. It has the what to do if you're stuck,
                but apart from that you should read the real one <a href="https://exponential-idle-guides.netlify.app/guides/2k-5k/">here. </a>
                It explains things better than me and includes pictures and a better overview of how graduations work

            <!--RUNDOWN-->
            <h2>Rundown</h2>
            <p><b><u>Estimated time: </u></b><br/>
                A few days to a week or 2</p>
            <p><b><u>What to do if you're stuck: </u></b><br/>
                If you are stuck for more then a few days you are probrably going something wrong. Are you:
                <ul>
                    <li>Using the correct autoprestige and autosupremacy formula? Using the incorrect autoprestige / supremacy formula can impede progress,
                        so make sure to check. The formulae are <a href="index.html">here</a></li>
                    <li>Autosupremacy needs you to do a manual supremacy to get it working. You must re do this manual supremacy every time you open the equation
                        menu. If you could afford some upgrades if you supremacied, you probably need to do a manual supremacy.</li>
                    <li>Supermacying in the right places? The general rule of thumb is to supremacy whenever you can afford an upgrade.</li>
                    <li>Buying / autobuying all variables/upgrades? With an autobuyer, or the buy all button, you can disable buying certain variables/upgrades,
                        which would definitely impede progress, On that note,</li>
                    <li>Buying upgrades? Some people don't see the upgrades menu. Press the word "variables" on the main equation screen. This will turn
                        your variable buy screen into the upgrade buy screen. Press upgrades to switch back. Not buying upgrades makes this section pretty
                        much impossible</li>
                    <li>Using the right student distribution? Use !sigma in the discord server or use
                        <a href="https://conicgames.github.io/exponentialidle/students.html">the student optimiser</a>.
                        Read <a href="IntroToGrad.html">intro to grad</a> for more info</li>
                    <li>Graduating in the right places? That grad route is 2k -> 4k -> 4.8k -> 5k</li>
                    <li>Underestimating the time taken? The 5k push can take upwards of a few days, and is a big timewall.</li>
                    <li>Asking for help in the discord server? Anything not mentioned here can almost always be answered by the amazing people on the discord
                        server</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p><b><u>Graduation route</u></b><br/>
            2k -> 4k -> 4.8k -> 5k<br/><br/>
            Alternate: If you accidentally graduate at 4.6k, its faster to push to 5k than to graduate at 4.8k and than recover. This will make the 5k push harder
            though. If you accidentally graduate at 4.4k, graduate at 4.6k before going to 5k. If you accidentally graduate at 4.2k or below, graduate at 4.8k
            before 5k
            </p>

            <p><b><u>Supremacy</u></b><br/>
                Supremacy is the 2nd level of prestige. It resets all normal and prestige upgrades for some psi. psi does NOT give any boost by itself, it is just
                a currency. Therefore there is almost no reason to supremacy when you can't afford something with your psi. There are exceptions. For example,
                there is an upgrade that costs 1000 psi. It is actually more efficient to do 2 supremacies at 500 dpsi each to get the 1000 required psi.<br/><br/>

                <b>Important!</b> If you are ever wondering when you supremacy, the rule of thumb is whenever you would be able to afford a new upgrade with the dpsi you
                get. This applies the moment you unlock it. Upon reaching ee50, you should immediately supremacy.<br/><br/>

                There is an exception to the rule. When you reach ee200, you will be forced to supremacy whether you want to or not. Thus, for what should be your
                third supremacy at f(t) = ee140, to afford \(y ^ {1.6}\), you should instead wait till you have to do a supremacy at ee200<br/><br/>

            </p>

            <p><b><u>Autosupremacy</u></b></p>
            <p>
                This costs an enormous amount of stars. So do not fret if you don't get it here. You are expected to get it in the next section. That said, if you
                do get it here, here it is!<br/><br/>

                timer(d(ln(db / b + 1) / pt) &lt 0)> 3 * tr && db > b&& dpsi + psi > min(min(costUpS(1),costUpS(2)), costUpS(3))&& ln(1 + max(1, log10(sf))
                /smooth(max(1, log10(gf)),(st > tr) * ee99)) / max(1, st) &ltsmooth(ln(1 + max(1, log10(sf)) /smooth(max(1, log10(gf)), (st > tr)* ee99)) /
                max(1, st), (pt > tr) * ee99)<br/><br/>
                
                Remember to set your mode to equation
                <b>IMPORTANT! After you input this, do a manual supremacy. Anytime you enter the edit expression field (the place where you put this in) you have to do another manual supremacy or this will break
                Also, you have to have you autobuyers set to x1 or xMax</b>
            </p>

            <p><b><u>The push to 5k</u></b><br/>
                When you're doing the push to 5k make sure to do the following:
                <ol>
                    <li>You must have 18 or 19 students for the push to 5k. If you have 17, than you should grad at 4.8k for 19 students. If you have 16, graduate
                        at 4.6k for 18 students. If you have 15 or less, why are you thinking about doing the 5k push, do get more students and come back</li>
                    <li>Get the correct autoprestige and autosupremcy formulae in and working. If you already have the correct autosupremacy formula do NOT open
                        the equation window, just leave it as is.</li>
                    <p>The final steps are the most Important</p>
                    <li>Update your student distribution as you go, and not just at the beginning. If you prefer, ready made student distributions for the
                        average run are below, though, your case may differ</li>
                    <li>Update your permanent level star distribution at least once after passing 4.6k</li>
                    <li>Mentally prepare for the long push (it may take a while)</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Notes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>When you get to 4995 f(t) turn of auto-prestige, it's faster to just cruise to 5k than to prestige and recover</li>
                    <li>When you get past 4.7k, with the required amount of students, sell auto-supremacy. You have maxed out your supremacy upgrades, and upgrade
                        3 requires upwards of 9.2k ft to reach, so it serves no use now, and the extra 100k stars can be used for permanent levels. You will
                        re-buy it after the push.</li>
                    <li>Never turn of your autobuy. This is because graduations are based off cumulative ft, so buying variables and upgrades can only make you
                        faster.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p><b><u>Common student distributions</u></b><br/>
                To save time using the student calculator, here are the most common student distributions for the average player

                <table>
                    <tr>
                        <th># of students</th>

            <p><b><u>Other miscellaneous info</u></b><br\>
                <ul>
                    <li>When saving up for a star upgrade, remember you can buy and sell anything at anytime so don't let your stars go unused! Buy permanent levels
                        while your waiting, and than sell them to buy the thing you're saving up for</li>
                    <li>What permanent levels should I buy?<br/>If you have all the variables bought, use the star calculator
                        <a href="https://conicgames.github.io/exponentialidle/stars.html">here</a>. Alternatively press the i button (next to the word "variables")
                        to see how much power each of your variables contributes, and put your stars in the strongest one (don't worry if there's a couple left
                        over)</li>
                </ul>
