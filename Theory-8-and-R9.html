            <h2>Synopsis</h2>
            <p>In this section of the game, you will have to continue revisiting most theories you have already completed, with the help of R9. This part is
            where the theory sim is going to come in useful, and R9 swapping (seaping) is your best friend.</p>
            <p>Not much to say here, the really never is, the guide explains most of it.</p>

            <!--RUNDOWN-->
            <h2>Rundown</h2>
            <h3>Estimated time: </h3>
            <p>See each individual theory</p>
            <h3>What to do if you're stuck: </h3>
            <p>If you are stuck for more then expected. Are you:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>R9 seaping?</b> R9 seaping provides a boost to f(t), so you need to R9 seap if you want the most out of your tau</li>
                <li><b>Just starting a theory?</b> When buying a theory, you have to move your students from phi upgrades to the theory. This means that your phi
                    will drop, so it will take a while for the tau to catch back up. This is most noticeable after buying t1</li>
                <li><b>Using the correct milestones?</b> Check out the milestone route for each theory</li>
                <li><b>Publishing at the right times?</b> Most theories you should publish under 20, except T2. The optimal pub multi's are found in each theories section</li>
                <li>Using the correct autoprestige and autosupremacy formula? Using the incorrect autoprestige / supremacy formula can impede progress,
                    so make sure to check. The formulae are <a href="index.html">here</a></li>
                <li>Autosupremacy needs you to do a manual supremacy to get it working. You must re do this manual supremacy every time you open the equation
                    menu. If you could afford some upgrades if you supremacied, you probably need to do a manual supremacy.</li>
                <li>Supermacying in the right places? The general rule of thumb is to supremacy whenever you can afford an upgrade.</li>
                <li>Buying / autobuying all variables/upgrades? With an autobuyer, or the buy all button, you can disable buying certain variables/upgrades,
                    which would definitely impede progress, On that note,</li>
                <li>Using the right student distribution? Use !sigma in the discord server or use
                    <a href="https://conicgames.github.io/exponentialidle/students.html">the student optimiser</a>.
                    Read <a href="IntroToGrad.html">intro to grad</a> for more info</li>
                <li>Graduating in the right places? The full grad route is below</li>
                <li>Asking for help in the discord server? Anything not mentioned here can almost always be answered by the amazing people on the discord
                    server</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Graduation route</h3>
            <p>14k -> 14.8k -> 15.6k -> 16k -> 16.8k -> 18k -> 20k</p>

            <!--THEORY BASICS-->
            <h2>Theory Basics</h2>
            <p>Publications are equivalent to prestiges for ft, so don't be afraid to use them. For the majority of theories, the optimal pub multi is below 20,
            though it varies by theory the notable exception is t2, which has an optimal pub multi in the thousands</p>

            <p>Each theory provides tau, equal to the maximum rho you have reached. Your total tau is the product of the tau from each theory.
            \(\tau = \tau_1 \times \tau_2...\)</p>

            <p>Each theory has milestones which speed up progress. You can always respec milestones and shuffle them around, so you can experiment as much as
            you wish. Some milestones provide instant benefits, whilst others can take longer the bear fruit. Some milestones are stronger than others</p>

            <p>You do not have to "complete" a theory to move on to the next one, nor do you have to stop a theory when you get all milestones. Play whichever
            theory is fastest</p>

            <h3>How to read the milestone route:</h3>
            <p>The milestone route is a list of distributions, from top to bottom. For example: 0/0/1/0, means you should buy 1 of the 3rd milestone from the
            top. Sometimes, buying milestones unlocks new ones, which can change what is shown. These are presented in a list.</p>

            <p>Here is an example distribution: 0/1/0 -> 1/1/0/0 -> 0/0/3 -> 1/1/0/1 -> 1/1/3/1</p>

            <p>This means you should start by buying the 2nd milestone, then get the first milestone, which unlocks the 4th milestone. Then, when you get 3
            milestones, respec your milestones and put them in the 3rd milestone, later, you should respec those milestones out of the 3rd milestone and put
            them in the 1st, 2nd, and 4th milestones. Finally, the next 3 milestones should go into the 3rd milestone</p>

            <h3>Common strategies:</h3>
            <p>There are some strategies that appear in many/all theories:</p>

            <p>Doubling strats are strats where you hold off buying stepwise variables to save up for more powerful doubling variables, by only buying stepwise
            variables at 10x less than doubling variables. They will usually have a d after their name. For example: t1d is the doubling strat for t1 (used
            only in 0-1e25), where you buy the stepwise variables \(q_1\) and \(c_1\) only when they are 10x lower than the cheapest doubling variable
            (\(min(q_2, c_2)\)) in order to save up for them</p>

            <p>Competing variables is when variables are added up. This means that the lower variable is "weaker" than the higher variable, because increasing
            it has less of an affect. Take this example: \(\dot{œÅ} = c_1 + c_2\), where \(c_1\) and \(c_2\) are both doubling variables. If \(c_1 = 10\), and
            \(c_2 = 1\) million, obviously, increasing \(c_1\) to something like 20, even though it's being doubled, has not much of an affect. Therefore, one
            should not buy \(c_1\)</p>

            <h3>Levels of activeness</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Active: Actively playing the game, performing active strats</li>
                <li>Idle: Can check in to publish the theory every so often (best is like 10 - 20 mins but can be longer)</li>
                <li>Overnight: Not checking the game for over many hours</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Note that even though these levels of activeness are given, it is almost always to play a new theory a good amount (~1e100 tau) although if you
            don't reach that when you unlock the next theory MOVE ON</p>
            <p>It as always best to use the <a href="https://tredec.github.io/sim-3.0/">theory simulator</a> to find out what theory to push.</p>
            <p>For info on the theory sim read <a href="https://exponential-idle-guides.netlify.app/guides/theory-sim/">here</a></p>


            <h3>Other:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>I'm calculating what my \(\dot{\rho}\) should be and it's not matching up! Remember, you have to include your pub multi in this calculation</li>
                    <li>What does \(\dot{\rho}\) mean? Explained in T2 overview, even though it's briefly in T1, \(\rho\) increases by \(\dot{\rho}\) every
                        second</li>
                </ul>


            <!--R9-->
            <h2>R9</h2>
            <h3>What is R9:</h3>
            <p>R9 is a new research (student) upgrade below theories. It costs 10 students and maxes out at 3 purchases. It does not have cost scaling</p>
            <p>Each level of R9 speeds up your theories by a factor of (total students / 20). This means now the more total students you have the faster your
            theories get. Also, each level of R9 speeds up your theories. This is how endgame players can get huge tau values</p>
            <p>R9 basically provides a boost to your theories that scale with the number of students you have.</p>
            <h3>R9 seaping (swapping):</h3>
            <p>Because R9 doesn't directly boost ft, if you want to push ft it would be beneficial to swap your students from R9 to other research upgrades.
            However, when R9 is not bought, theories move really slowly. Thus, a strat was made called R9 swapping or R9 seaping. To perform an R9 swap one must
            do the following:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Wait till ft stops growing with R9 bought</li>
                <li>Start holding accel (preferably hold it all the time but you don't have to do that)</li>
                <li>Take students out of R9 and put them into other research upgrades (use the student calc)</li>
                <li>When ft slows down enough, prestige, or wait for autoprestige</li>
                <li>Put students back into R9</li>
                <li>Repeat</li>
            </ol>
            <p><i>note that sometimes autoprestige will take a very long time to prestige, so sometimes you may want to just prestige manually</i></p>
            <p>For the most best result, R9 swap for as many prestiges as possible. Lategame, it becomes near impossible to prestige without R9 swapping</p>

            <!--RECURRANCE RELATIONS-->
            <h2>Theory 8 - Chaos Theory</h2>
            <p>Unlike other theories, T8 is not considered a "stage" of the game, as here you will play T8 but also go back to other theories with R9</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Expected time:</b>N/A</li>
                <li><b>Local Grad Route:</b>N/A</li>
                <li><b>Stuck?</b> Read the General Info</li>
                <li><b>Milestone route:</b> 1/0/0/0 -> 2/0/0/0 -> 0/0/0/2 -> 0/0/0/3 -> 1/0/0/3 -> 2/0/3/0 -> 2/3/3/0 -> 2/3/3/3. The swap from 2/0/0/0 to 0/0/0/2
                happens at e52 \(\rho\)</li>
                <li><b>One sentence description:</b> Very chaotic; slow before 1e60, speed afterwords.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>T8 overview:</h3>
                <p>T8 is based off chaos theory. The variables x, y, and z represents a point that is moving very chaotically through R3, and is very difficult
                to predict where it will move next. The variables \(c_3\), \(c_4\), and \(c_5\) are all multiplied by \(\dot{x}\), \(\dot{y}\), or \(\dot{z}\),
                and are thus affected by this chaotic motion.</p>
                <p>The main equation of T8 is pretty simple. The complexity arises from the chaotic changes in \(\dot{x}\), \(\dot{y}\), and \(\dot{z}\)</p>
            <h3>Optimal publication multiplier:</h3>
                <p>2.5 - 5</p>
            <h3>Theory pushing</h3>
                <p>N/A</p>
            <h3>Strategies:</h3>
                <p>Like many other theories, T8 strategy is based on competing variables. However, this is made more complex by the chaotic nture of x, y, and z,
                which affect variable power</p>
