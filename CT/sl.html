            <h2>Sequential Limits (SL)</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Sim time to completion:</b> 288 days</li>
                <li><b>Dev:</b> Ellipsis</li>
                <li><b>Milestone route:</b> 0/0/0/2 → 0/0/2/2 → 3/0/2/2 → 3/5/2/2</i></li>
                <li><b>One sentence description:</b> TBA</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>SL overview:</h3>
                <p>SL is based of a variation of stirlings approximation for e. Stirlings approximation is an expression that approaches e and x approches
                infinity:</p>
                <p>\(lim_{x \rightarrow \infty} \frac{x}{\sqrt[x]{x!}} = e\)</p>
                <p>In the theory \(\frac{x}{\sqrt[x]{x!}}\) is represented the the symbol \(\gamma\)</p>
                <p>Essentially, the higher x is, the closer \(\gamma\) is to e</p>
                <p>Stirlings approximation is linear, that is, doubling x, makes \(\gamma\) twice as close to e</p>
                <p>Approximations like this are often used to calculate the value of e by plugging in larger and larger values for x</p>

            <h3>Equation breakdown</h3>
                <blockquote>\(\dot{\rho_1} = \frac{\sqrt{\rho_2}}{e - \gamma}\)</blockquote>
                <blockquote>\(\gamma = \frac{\rho_3}{\sqrt[\rho_3]{\rho_3!}}\)</blockquote>
                <blockquote>\(\dot{\rho_2} = a_1a_2a_3^{-ln(\rho_3)}\)</blockquote>
                <blockquote>\(\dot{\rho_3} = b_1b_2\)</blockquote>
                <blockquote>\(a_3 = 2\)</blockquote>
                <p>The first equation shows that \(\dot{\rho_1}\) is affected by \(\rho_2\) (half effectiveness) and how close \(\gamma\) is to e<br/>
                Half effectiveness means that quadrupling \(\rho_2\) only doubles \(\rho_1\).</p>
                <p>The 2nd equation is stirlings approximation, and shows us that the closeness of gamma to e is proportional to \(\rho_3\)</p>
                <p>The next equations are simple and show that \(a_{12}\) increases \(\rho_2\) and \(b_{12}\) increases \(\rho_3\)</p>
                <p>Interestingly, \(\dot{\rho_2}\) is DECREASED by \(a_3\) and \(\rho_3\), meaning to increase \(\rho_2\) you should decrease those</p>
                <p>The final equation shows the value of \(a_3\) which can be lowered through milestones</p>

                <p>Overall the effectiveness of each variable is</p>
                <table>
                    <tr><td>\(a_1\)</td><td>Increases \(\dot{\rho_2}\) by approx 52%, though due to the square root this is only a 26% increase in \(\rho_1\)</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>\(a_2\)</td><td>Increases \(\dot{\rho_2}\) by 2x</td></tr>

            <h3>Optimal publication multiplier:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>0 - e90: 5 - 8</li>
                <li>e90 - e200: 9 - 9.5</li>
                <li>e200-e300: 6 - 8</li>
                <li>e300+: 7.5 - 8.5</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Strategies:</h3>
            <p>Every variable does not affect \(\rho_1\) directly, affecting either \(\rho_2\) or \(\rho_3\), which usually takes a while to build up. Therefore, near
            the end of a publication, you should stop buying them, because by the time the upgrades have built up, you've past the optimal pub multi. Thus we
            have the strat SLStopAd. I would like to remove the Mod part for simplicity, but I am afraid I may make the start unviable. Therefore, a simplified form,
            is not included, and the form with mod10 is listed only for notice, as the speed gain from SLStopAd is rarely enough to justify using over the idle
            strat SLStopA. We recommend only using SLStopA and SLMS</p>

            <p>SL has a MS strat as well. This MS strat is quite difficult, however, without manual buying it might be not too bad. It's also good at get some
            MS practice in, <s>and if I have to suffer SLMS you all do too</s>. Therefore I have decided to include SLMS here as well (again, SLMSd is not
            included)</p>
            <h4>SLMS</h4>
            <p class="important">SLMS is a DIFFICULT strat to perform. If you find it overly difficult, please feel free to ignore this section</p>
            <table>
                <tr><td>State 1</td><td>\(4 \rightarrow 3 \rightarrow 1 \rightarrow 2\) (prioritieses \(\rho_3\))</td>
                <tr><td>State 2</td><td>\(2 \rightarrow 1 \rightarrow 4 \rightarrow 3\) (prioritieses \(\rho_2\))</td>
                <tr><td>State 3</td><td>\(1 \rightarrow 2 \rightarrow 4 \rightarrow 3\) (prioritieses \(\rho_1\))</td>
            </table>
            <p>This notation tells you the priority order to buy milestones. For example \(4 \rightarrow 3 \rightarrow 1 \rightarrow 2\) means to max out the 4th
            milestone (from the top) then the 3rd then the 1st then the 2nd</p>
            <table>

                <tr><td>1e150 - 1e175</td><td>8      </td><td>6      </td><td>-      </td></tr>
                <tr><td>1e175 - 1e200</td><td>1.5    </td><td>1      </td><td>SKIP   </td></tr>
                <tr><td>1e200 - 1e275</td><td>3      </td><td>SKIP   </td><td>-      </td></tr>
                <tr><td>1e275 - 1e300</td><td>2      </td><td>SKIP   </td><td>-      </td></tr>
            </table>
            <p>This table tells you when to swap to each state. Start in state 1 and read the number in the box (I'm calling it "n"). When your \(\rho_1\)
            reaches "n" times less then the next \(b_{12}\) upgrade, swap to State 2. Now you have a new "n". When your \(\rho_1\) again reaches "n" times less
            then the next \(b_{12}\) upgrade with the new "n", swap to State 3 (note that for one of the stages there is no swapping to state 3.). Finally, when
            you can afford and buy the upgrade, or your \(\rho\) drops back down due to another upgrade, swap back to State 1</p>
            <p>For variable purchase, follow the SLStopA strat. Therefore you don't have to worry about variables and just focus on the MS. If you want to take a
            break, just leave it in state 1 and come back. Any amount of active play is beneficial. (SLMSd is just the same thing with the SLStopAd strat anyway)</p>
            <p>This strategy is over 2x faster then SLStopA, so I suggest doing it if you can. Plus, it's more fun then just waiting</p>
