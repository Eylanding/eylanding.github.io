            <h2>Some Nomenclature + Recap</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Active-Idle ratio:</b> The difference between how fast active is and how fast idle is. For example a ratio of 2 means that playing active
                is 2x faster then playing idle. Generally, Active-Idle ratios above 1.1-1.2 are considered active, with above 1.5 considered very active</li>
                <li><b>d strats:</b> Strats that involve buying some variables at constant ratios to other variables. For example, buying \(c_1\) when it costs
                10x less then \(c_2\)</li>
                <li>In this guide, MS is considered optional if it is 1-1.5x faster to do MS. MS is considered semi optional if it is 1.5-3x faster to do MS, and
                considered non-optional is it is over 3x faster to do MS</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The complexity ratings given is a rating on how approachable each CT is. For example basic theory \(\dot{\rho} = c_1c_2\) would be given a rating of
                1/5. Complexity rating takes into account both difficulty of comprehending the math, and difficulty of executing the strats. Difficulty of
                execution is NOT activity. A theory that requires you to press a button every 5 minutes is very easy to execute, but also very active
            </p>

            <h2>What CT should I push?</h2>
            <p>
                There are a lot of custom theories out now. A total of 9 have been released! WSP, SL, EF, CSR2, FI, FP, RZ, MF and BaP. A natural question is,
                which one should I play? The guide aims to help you answer that question
            </p>
            <p>
                Firstly, there is no right answer! You can play whichever CT you want to play, and we encourage you to play around and find out what CTs you like
                the most. However if you are looking for some guidance, here is a quick rundown of each CT, gameplay wise.<br/>
                Personally, I recommend starting with some lower complexity theories, some good idle theories (to overnight) and ideally some fast early game
                theories<br/>
                For those trying to play optimally, CTs are <b>not</b> effected by R9, and thus the greedy method is optimal
            </p>
            <h3>CT meta-data table</h3>
            <p>Execution complexity refers to the complexity of the optimal strategies. Forced Execution complexity includes only non-optional strats + active</p>
            <p>Math complexity is not what it looks like! Sometimes, theories can look intimidating, but are actually not that bad if you sit and think about it</p>
            <p>Math complexity also include a bit of a hidden element about how difficult a strat is to DERIVE. This may be based off of hidden factors such as
            variable cost functions, so math complexity may not reflect the above</p>
            <p>Activity is how active the theory is considered as a whole. Activity (min) is how active the theory is at it's most idle part</p>
            <p>Example: SL has this scary looking equation \(\frac{x}{\sqrt[x]{x!}}\). In a vacuum this would be difficult to analyse. However, a quick google
            search (or guide search) reveals that this is an approximation for the value <b>e</b>, and with a bit of experimentation, one can determine how
            quickly it converges. Thus, it is given a score of 2, as it is difficult to being with, but can be simplified</p>

            </p>
            <h3>WSP</h3>
            <p>
                <b>Complexity</b><br/>
                WSP is relatively simple theory (Complexity 2/5). Gameplay-wise, WSP is quite simple, using only d strats with optional MS. The math contains a scary looking
                product but can be generally simplified to more \(\chi\) = more \(\rho\)
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Speed</b><br/>
                WSP takes 4 years and 333 days to complete, making it the slowest theory in the game. WSP is slow to start, with the very earlygame being somewhat 
                of a timewall but very good early game, with tau/hour
                jumping after the first few milestones, peaking at 12 at 1e250 rho and staying above 1 until 1e660. 1e660 can be achieved in 3 days active.<br/>
                WSP is 15 days to 1e900, 30 days to 1e1000, 68 days to 1e1100, 158 days to 1e1200 and so on
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Activity</b><br/>
                On average WSP has a consistent active-idle ratio of 1.3, and has pub multi's around 8. It reaches 8h of pub time at 1e825 rho. It is an active
                theory
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Conclusion</b><br/>
                Overall, WSP is a good beginner theory, and is quite fast in the early game. You should play it early, but don't expect to complete it. Like, ever
            </p>
            <h3>SL</h3>
            <p>
                <b>Complexity</b><br/>
                SL is a mostly simple theory (Complexity 3/5). Gameplay-wise SL has only d strats and semi-optional MS. The semi-optional MS swaps between 3 states, making
                it relatively difficult to perform. SL contains a lot of cumulative variables and thus has strong coasting strats. The math contains many intertwined
                cumulative variables, making it look intimidating on first glance, but can be easily broken down
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Speed</b><br/>
                SL takes 288 days to complete, making it the 3rd slowest theory to complete. SL has a fairly normal decay amount, with it's tau/hour peaking at 19
                in the first publication, and dropping to 1-2 at around 1e60, where it stays, jumping around with milestones until finally falling below 1 at 1e440<br/>
                SL takes 25 days to reach 1e900, 37 days to 1e1000, 54 days to 1e1100, 78 days to 1e1200, 112 days to 1e1300 and so on
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Activity</b><br/>
                SL has no good active strats and when MS is not an option has an active-idle ratio of near 1. Pre-1e300 when SLMS is an option, it is a very active
                theory. Post 1e300, or if you choose not to do SLMS, SL is a very idle theory. It has multiple cumulative variables, meaning it does well idle. It
                has an average pub multi around 8. It reaches 8h pubs at 1e750 (14 days in) and from then on can be a good overnight.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Conclusion</b><br/>
                SL is a good beginner theory and a good choice for a theory you can idle. The MS is not the most friendly, but is a good way of learning or
                practicing your MS skill, which will are important if you want to play efficiently, and is a fun part of the game. You should play it early, but
                don't expect to complete it for a long time
            </p>
            <h3>EF</h3>
            <p>
                <b>Complexity</b><br/>
                EF is a relatively simple theory (Complexity 1.5/5). Gameplay-wise, EF has 3 different currencies that are generally separate, with R and I used to purchase \(a_12\).
                Other than those 2, all the variables are simply multiplied together, with \(sin^2(t)\) and \(cos^2(t)\) which can be thought of as 1/2 on average.
                Mathematically, the theory is mostly just multiplication and competing variables, which make it look more complex then it actually is
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Speed</b><br/>
                EF takes 132 days to complete making it one of the completable theories. It has a rho/tau conversion of 1.6, meaning that whilst rho will appear to
                grow slowly, the theory is faster then it looks. EF starts off fast but very quickly falls below 1 at 1e25 for the 1e50 timewall. Surpassing that
                time well rates will again jump to 7 falling back down and jumping back up as new milestones are unlocked. This theory survives of milestones.
                This continues until 1e200 where the rates fall below 0.5 for the last time and stays between 0.2 and 0.05 tau/hour for the rest of the theory
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Activity</b><br/>
                EF has many cumulative variables and no MS. This makes it a very good idle theory with and average active/idle ratio of 1.06ish.
                Pub's before milestones generally have long publication times with 28 -> 30, 33 -> 50 having pub times over 8h hours. The timewall at 1e50 is
                actually helpful here as the publications leading up to it can be overnighted for little to no time loss. Whether a publication is overnightable
                depends on where you are in the theory compared to the relatively frequent milestones, so they have to be checked on a case by case basis
                with the theory sim.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Conclusion</b><br/>
                EF is a decent beginner theory, although it's incredibly slow start means that I would not recommend it to new players. If you are trying to play
                optimally, EF's timewall at 1e50 is decent for a few overnights without significant timeloss, as EF generally will have to be pushed past 1e50 at
                some point. You will have to play it at some point, and if you are looking for an early idle theory it can provide, but I would hold off playing EF
                for a bit, and not play it first
            </p>
            <h3>CSR2</h3>
            <p>
                <b>Complexity</b><br/>
                CSR2 is a decently simple theory in my opinion (3/5). CSR2 is what I like to call the quintessential CT. I find CSR2 the perfect inbetween from main theories to custom theories. It introduces much of the
                complexity of custom theories. Whilst it does have some complexity in its recurrence relation and a more difficult MS strat, the doubling strats are
                quite straightforward and the strategies are nothing new. The MS is on the more difficult and complicated side, so may not need to be attempted,
                although it is 2x faster, making it semi-optional
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Speed</b><br/>
                CSR2 takes 1 year and 73 days to complete, making it the 2nd slowest theory to complete. It has a fairly normal decay rate in early game, staying
                above 1 tau/hour and spiking to about 4 at each milestone. The theory spikes to 16 at 1e80 and stays very strong for the next 100 rho. It stays above
                5 tau/hour until 1e250, and first drops below 1 at 1e600. This makes it an extremely strong theory earlygame, at the level of WSP. Lack of endgame
                milestones make decay start post 500, and thus like WSP it falls off far before the cap<br/>
                CSR2 takes 2d 12h to 1e500, 26d to 1e1000, 45d to 1e1100, 80d to 1e1200, 139d to 1e1300 and so on

                CSR2 has no cumulative variables. Before 1e500 it is very active, with MS semi-optional MS strats (CSR2XLII is 2x better than CSR2d). If you do not
                do MS, CSR2 is still active but with a much kinder ratio (1.17 active/idle ratio). However, CSR2 has bad post optimal pub multi decay and does not
                get 8h pubs until 1e1100 which is very late into the theory with rates well below 0.1. CSR2 is definitely an active theory and definitely should not
                be considered if you are looking for an idle theory

                <b>Conclusion</b><br/>
                In my opinion, CSR2 is the quintessential CT. It is active, but in doing so you have to interact with the doubling strats. Its equations and
                strategies feel reminiscent of the main game, and it is a great bridge to move into CTs. I recommend playing CSR2 as one of your first CTs,
                especially if you are willing to push it past 1e80. With optional MS, you don't have to do it. If you are a beginner, I recommend trying the MS, but
                remembering it is optional, as CSR2XLII is a very difficult strat
