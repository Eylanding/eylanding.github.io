            </ul>

            <h3>MF Overview</h3>
            <p class="important">Without reading this overview, a lot of the equations will seem completely random and nonsensical</p>
            <p>
                MF is based around the Magnetic Field equations, the equations that govern the motion of a charged particle in the sinusoidal field. This theory
                simulates the movement of a charged particle with mass \(m\) and charge \(q\) in a solenoid of infinite length with current \(I\) and a
                density of turns \(\delta\) creating magnetic field \(B\).
            </p>
            <p>
                A solenoid is a type of electromagnet formed by a helical coil of wire whose length is significantly greater than its diameter. When a current of
                electricity is passed through it. Our solenoid in this theory has properties that are determined by our upgrades.
            </p>
            <p>
                For this simulation we consider a particle starting at position \(x = 0\), and time \(t_s = 0\), with an initial velocity given by the \(v_i\)
                purchasable variables. Due the the magnetic field created by the solenoid effecting our particle, it moves in a helix like pattern with a constant
                \(x\) velocity and \(\omega\) angular frequency, a measure of how much it spins around in the helix pattern (rad/s). Because of
                this, buying \(v_i\) variables will have no effect until the simulation is reset and the new initial velocities can be applied
            </p>
            <p>
                Furthermore, MF is the first theory to implement a second prestige layer, by having a prestige layer below publications. This new prestige layer
                is representative of "resetting" the simulating and applying the new \(v_i\) conditions, which does not reset upgrades but does reset the particles
                \(x\) position by resetting \(t_s\) to 0
            </p>

            <h3>Equation breakdown</h3>
            <blockquote>$$\dot{\rho} = Cc_1c_2\omega^{4.1}x^{3.2}v^{1.3}$$</blockquote>
            <blockquote>$$v = \sqrt{v_x^2 + v_y^2 + v_z^2}$$</blockquote>
            <blockquote>$$x = v_xt_s$$</blockquote>
            <blockquote>$$B = \mu_0I\delta$$</blockquote>
            <p><i>The value B above represents the magnetic flux density, which is (simplified) a measure of the strength of a magnetic field</i></p>
            <blockquote>$$\omega = \frac{q}{m}B$$</blockquote>
            <blockquote>$$v_x = [v_1v_2 \times 10^{-20}](t_s = 0)$$</blockquote>
            <blockquote>$$v_y = [v_3v_4 \times 10^{-18}](t_s = 0) \times sin(\omega t_s)$$</blockquote>
            <blockquote>$$v_z = [v_3v_4 \times 10^{-18}](t_s = 0) \times cos(\omega t_s)$$</blockquote>
            <blockquote>$$\dot{I} = \frac{a_1}{400}(10^{-15}-\frac{I}{a_2})$$</blockquote>
            <blockquote>$$m = 1e-3, q = 1.602e-19, \mu_0 = 4\pi \times 10^{-7}$$</blockquote>
            <p>
                That's a lot of equations. The most equations I've seen in a custom theory that actually matter. Luckily, most of it is just a bunch of
                multiplication, so it is not that complex. C is an arbitrary balancing term that changes with milestones
            </p>
            <p>
                Also, you may notice this term: \((t_s = 0)\). This means that this equations is not always true. It "updates" to become true then you reset the
                particle, setting \(t_s = 0\). For instance: 
                $$v_x = [v_1v_2 \times 10^{-20}](t_s = 0)$$
                This question determines that \(v_x = v_1v_2 \times 10^{-20}\). However, purchasing \(v_{12}\) will not have an immediate effect of \(v_x\) - instead
                it will only update when you reset the particle, and reset \(t_s\).<br/>
                As explained in the overview, this is because the \(v_i\) variables represent the initial conditions of the magneti field simulation, and thus have
                no effect until the simulation is reset
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally, there is an equation that should look familiar from t5
                $$\dot{I} = \frac{a_1}{400}(10^{-15} - \frac{I}{a_2})$$
                This is the logistic function equations we saw in T5, however it some crucial differences:
                <ol>
                    <li>\(a_2\) does not appear on the denominator below \(a_1\) as it did in T5. This means \(a_2\) has no negative effect. It only increases the
                    cap</li>
                    <li>There is no middle "I" term as there is in T5. This means that instead of the function naturally growing exponentially to the cap, It
                    instead grows linearly, making it slower, and \(a_1\) more important</li>
                    <li>The number that the \(\frac{I}{a_2}\) term is subtracted from is \(10^{-15}\), meaning that cap is \(10^{-15}a_2\), not \(a_2\)</li>
                </ol>
            </p>
            <p>With this knowledge, we can simplify the equations - although in doing so we must abstract away from the physical representation</p>
            <blockquote>$$\dot{\rho} = Cc_1c_2\omega^{4.1}x^{3.2}v^{1.3}$$</blockquote>
            <blockquote>$$\omega = 4\pi \times 1.602e-23 \times I\delta$$</blockquote>
            <blockquote>$$\dot{I} = \frac{a_1}{400}(10^{-15} - \frac{I}{a_2})$$</blockquote>
            <blockquote>$$\dot{x} = v_1v_2(t_s = 0)$$</blockquote>
            <blockquote>$$v = \sqrt{v_1^2v_2^2 + v_3^2v_4^2}(t_s = 0)$$</blockquote>
            <p><i>The above is for low \(\omega\) making \(sin(\omega) \approx 0\)</i></p>
            <p>Or even simpler, assuming continuous particle resets, and merging all constants - a method that allows us the analyse the effect of each variable in
            a vacuum</p>
            <blockquote>$$\dot{\rho} = Cc_1c_2I^{4.1}\delta^{4.1}v_1^{3.2}v_2^{3.2}t_s^{3.2}(v_1^2v_2^2 + v_3^2v_4^2)^{0.65}$$</blockquote>
            <p>And thus the variable breakdown</p>

            <h3>Strategy</h3>
            <p>
                Strategy in MF revolves around the central question: When should you reset the particle? Resetting the particle as we have seen is a tradeoff between
                the short term (decreases x immediately) and the long term (higher \(v_{1234}\) = higher x & v later on). Of course, you do not want to reset too
                often, lest you never let \(t_s\) build, but you also do not want to reset to rarely, and lose out on higher \(v_{1234}\).
            </p>
            <p>
                No hard and fast strategy has been proven best, and many people do their own way, but I recommend the strategy made by d4Nf6Bg51-0:
                (No names have been assigned as of yet)

                    <li>next \(v_2\) level costs 1e3 or more less then next \(v_4\) level, and you can afford 2x \(v_2\) and 1x \(v_4\)</li>

                </ul>
                Purchase the given amounts of \(v_{24}\) and enough \(v_{13}\) so that the next upgrades cost more then the \(v_{24}\) upgrade costs
            </p>
            <h4>Alt: MF Strat 2</h4>
            <p>
                Purchase \(v_{1234}\) and reset when:
