            <h3>FI Overview</h3>
            <p>FI is based on the idea of a fractional integral. For example, half integrating a function twice is the same as regular integrating it once</p>
            <p>The actual definition of a fractional integral is complicated but unimportant. The idea that is that it is a smooth way to interpolate from 
            a function (it's 0th integral) to its integral (or 1st integral). For example, the 0.01th integral of a function is very similar to the unchanged
            function, and the 0.99th integral is very similar to it's regular integral</p>

            <p>A good explanation of the fraction integral can be found on
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dwQUUDt5Is&t=1326s"> this youtube video</a></p>
            <p>Typically, a fractional integral is notated using this notation: \(_{\lambda}\int f(x)dx\), where \(\lambda\) is the fraction.<br/>
            For example, \(_{\frac{1}{2}}\int f(x) dx\) is the half integral of f(x)</p>

            <p>This main equation shows that \(\dot{\rho}\) is proportional to t, r, and \(\sqrt[\pi]q\)</p>
            <p>After the main equation changes it is proportional to t, r, m, n, and \(\sqrt[\pi]{(\int g)(q/\pi)}\)</p>
            <p>Now, g is always a polynomial, so to approximate the integral g(x) we can take the highest exponent in the polynomial and increase it by one to
            make a new, very simple polynomial. This of course, is not a very good approximation, it ignores coefficients, but the exponent is the thing tha
            matters here. For example, the integral of the Milestone 0 equation can be thought of as \(x^5\), so after milestone 0, rho is proportional to
            \(\sqrt[\pi]{q^5}\) or \(q^{5/\pi} \approx q^{1.59}\) ignoring coefficients</p>
            <p>The fact that this exponent is higher then one, means tht q's affect on \(\dot{\rho}\) is greater then other variables</p>
            <p>The 2nd line is the equation for \(\dot{r}\). This equation shows that \(\dot{r}\) is proportional to how close the 2 integrals are.</p>
            <p>One integral is a normal integral, but the other is a fractional integral. As shown before, as the fraction approaches 1, the two integrals
            get closer together. Thus, as \(\lambda\) approaches one, the fractional integral approaches the normal integral, and \(\dot{r}\) increases</p>
            <p>The \(\lambda\) equations are all equations that converge to 1. The first equation adds 1/2 then 1/4 then 1/8. Each successive addition moves
            half the remaining distance to 1, and slowly converges on it. The next equations do the same time, but instead of half the distance it's 2/3 or 3/4</p>
            <p>And thus, we can determine the strengths of each variable</p>

            <h3>Strategy</h3>
            <p class="important">The theory is very new, so the strategies are not fully developed. These strategies are unoptimised and subject to change</p>
            <p>FI, having many time dependant variables, is a relatively idle theory, so autobuy all isn't too bad. FI, whilst having some of thw most complicated
            equations, really just has d strats and some basic MS (I say basic MS it's still kinda hard).</p>
            <p>Like many other theories, FI has a milestone swapping strat. The \(q_1\) exp milestones increase q gain, and the m and n variable milestones
            increase \(\dot{\rho}\). The way milestone swapping works is that every so often you swap to \(q_1\) exp to build up q, and then swap to  m and n
            variables to actually grow \(\rho\). The reason this works is that the benefit of having \(q_1\) milestones (i.e. high q) remain even after you
            swap out of them</p>
            <p>To perform MS you want to swap between the normal milestone route given about, and prioritising the \(q_1\) exponent milestone. The best way
            to describe it is that when your swapping your milestones, max out \(q_1\) exponent, then put you remaining milestones in the normal route. However,
            ALWAYS prioritise perma level locked upgrades over other upgrades. The buy order is \(q_1\) exp → perma level locked milestones → other milestones.
            Of course, if the milestone resets q, i.e. the g(x) milestone, don't respec it, just keep it bought</p>
            <p>FI is heavily effected by stepwise variables. The variable \(q_1\) has a step length of 21, meaning upgrade 21-22, 42-43 etc. are much stronger.
            The variable n has a step length of 11</p>
